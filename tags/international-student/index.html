            <p class="desc">As time goes on in my journey of experimenting with different technologies on building a web interface, I figured it‚Äôs time for my personal site to return to the fundamentals. So I decided to build it with only HTML &#43; CSS with one of the goals being that it should work perfectly fine with JavaScript disabled.
Before this, it‚Äôs built with Vue. You can still find the source here.

            <p class="desc">While Vue 3 has been out of beta for quite a while, (as noted on their website) a migration build is still a work in progress so the current advice is to stay with Vue 2 if it‚Äôs a non-trivial project. I procrastinated on this article for so long that a migration build has since been released. Feel free to check it out here.
That said, as Parcel v1 is no longer maintained (and with v2 supporting only Vue 3), I figured it‚Äôs time to upgrade....</p>

So instead, this has to be setup and handled manually. We‚Äôd use brew here since it comes installed in the OS image and is the easiest way to deal with it as far as I‚Äôm aware....</p>

            <p class="desc">When working on a project with Vue (TypeScript), I faced a lot of roadblocks trying to get code coverage to work. The issue is largely covered in this issue thread. Most solutions / workarounds for that seems to revolve around changing the bundling flow with webpack. Considering my lack of familiarity with webpack (on top of my use of scss and pug in Vue files), putting together a webpack config that works for me turns out to be extremely challenging....</p>

As I was setting up my machine and going through tutorials step-by-step, I was slightly annoyed by the fact that the development of Go projects are limited to inside the $GOPATH.
Personally, I have all my side projects stored at the top level of the computer....</p>

According to Wikipedia, it means ‚ÄúRequirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.‚Äù Basically, you would first have to write the test of the software/feature you are developing before you start working on the developing the software/feature itself.

But their free tier can be quite limited, it can also get costly quickly if you are paying for each separate project. So instead, I decided to explore putting all of them together using NGINX (recommended to me by Jane Manchun Wong).
