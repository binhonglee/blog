            <p class="row subtitle">Why being skilled makes you look unskilled</p>
            <p class="desc">I’ve seen multiple different people fail their promotions due to “lack of technical complexity” in their work. While some of this rings true, more often than not, the underlying technical complexity of their work is not properly understood because - ironically - they cut through it smoothly as strong technical engineers. Unless you were doing code / design reviews for them, you wouldn’t notice it. On the flip side, I’ve had projects listed as my capstone “technical complexity” project of the year that imo wasn’t very complex compared to some other stuff I needed to work on. Why is this happening and how do I make sure my work is properly valued?

            <p class="row subtitle">Why empathy wins</p>
            <p class="desc">It’s a common problem at work where you see a problem but you’re having a hard time trying to convince people to support your attempt at fixing it. Worse still, they might not even see it as a problem (or they don’t think it’s something that warrants any attention from anyone). I’m approaching this piece mostly from an “I need my leadership / partners to understand what I do is important” perspective. But the ideology can similarly be used on other occasions like selling an idea to your peers etc. Ideally you start thinking about this as you try to get the green light to pursue your project instead of attempting to justify it after you’ve already invested your time into it with little to show for it.

            <p class="row subtitle">Sometimes good coding practice isn&#39;t good enough</p>
            <p class="desc">Most software engineers think of this as “someone else’s problem” (usually a privacy engineer or security engineer), but realistically, there’s only so much stuff (bad code lol) they can catch. Especially if you work in some of the more sensitive areas, it’s not realistic to have them do code audits for every change. This means that you as the code author (or reviewer) need to at least pick up some basic instincts about things that can pose risks.

            <p class="row subtitle">Symptoms of an unhealthy reliability system</p>
            <p class="desc">We love celebrating heroes in general. So when a hero shows up to save the day, it’s only natural that we make sure to recognize their contribution. While it might feel counterintuitive, we should strive to not need heroes entirely instead of hoping that next time when tragedy strikes, a hero will turn up once again. This is not to diminish the value of heroes. They still play a very important role in firefighting and are doing the right thing in an urgent situation. However, in a perfect world, they shouldn’t be necessary at all and we should at least aspire to work towards building a system with that level of reliability.

            <p class="row subtitle">Take a deep breath, you got this!</p>
            <p class="desc">I wrote a similar version of this internally at Meta a few years ago for my org after finding myself in the middle of a few SEV1s in a row – and being consulted / asked for support in other similar situations. I thought this might be something useful to share (as a public version) as well. This won’t be perfectly fitting for all use cases, but having a runbook works as an anchor in the midst of chaos, helping to get you unstuck from “what’s next?”. Admittedly, this is an incomplete runbook that serves more as a template for your team or company to complete with more specific tooling guides (using which tool to achieve what, etc.).

            <p class="row subtitle">Making the business case for building dev tools</p>
            <p class="desc">I’m largely approaching this from the perspective of building an internal dev tool (since this is mostly where my personal experiences are coming from), especially if you’re someone who wants to build an internal tool but is having trouble framing it in a way where its value can be understood by the decision makers. I’m also excluding situations where you “have to” build certain tools to track certain information in order to comply with a legal requirement, since I don’t think that would be controversial to comply with. I’d imagine the framework for using an external dev tool, while similar, also poses extra complexity on paying vs building.

            <p class="row subtitle">When and what to build for internal tools?</p>
            <p class="desc">For years, I built and maintained the only logged-out accessible dev tool set / platform at Meta. That earned me some reputation (in a certain circle) of being “the idea guy on internal tools”. Whenever I’m asked about how I keep coming up with good ideas for valuable tools to build, my go-to answer has been “I build tools when I get annoyed while doing my job”. I’ll try to expand that into more details below.

            <p class="row subtitle">Is it a mid-level engineer yet?</p>
            <p class="desc">I keep hearing about vibe-coding and I’ve always written the majority of code myself. While at Meta, I got a chance to try out CodeCompose. It worked really well as an autocomplete but when it tried to do anything more than 5 lines at a time, it would - on many occasions - commit bugs that aren’t immediately obvious at first sight. Generally, I’ve caught them by looking at the generated code and wondering “huh this isn’t how I’d do this, why?”. That said, it definitely helped me code and ship faster especially on mundane tasks. Vibe-coding though, seems like taking it to a whole new level (using even less supervision and care on the code being committed).

            <p class="row subtitle">Holding the quality bar for user experience</p>
            <p class="desc">Mature growth teams would organize a centralized experiment review meeting as a way to share learnings to a wider audience, consult for feedback / next step recommendations, while also holding engineers accountable for the changes they are attempting to ship. The review sessions should be open to anyone to sign up (presenting their experiments) or to participate in general. However, key decision makers (like senior growth engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists) should be required to attend so decisions to ship / not ship / iterate will be made with everyone’s concerns addressed.

            <p class="row subtitle">Taking fine-tuning to the next level</p>
            <p class="desc">While I’ve shipped a lot of growth wins (literally the first line on my resume), I’m actually very far from a prototypical growth engineer. That said, in this piece, I want to explore a bit more into what it’s like being a growth engineer and what makes you good at being one. Growth engineers are generally 1 -&gt; 100 experts instead of 0 -&gt; 1. They fine-tune every little detail by running a lot of experiments with marginal changes to understand the user problem and drive growth impact (line goes up).
