            <p class="desc">If you‚Äôre on Facebook or Instagram, you‚Äôve probably seen Meta AI being plugged as part of search. However, in my opinion, they‚Äôre not doing it correctly. They are making the LLM answer the prompt as if it were a generic question. Instead, they should make use of the LLM to find personalized answers based on content they can access. I know it sounds confusing, but I promise it will be worth your time. Let me explain.

            <p class="desc">It‚Äôs never easy to come up with new ideas that help with growth, but identifying the problem makes it easier. You‚Äôll notice that for the most part in this piece, I‚Äôll talk about ‚Äúwhere‚Äù the opportunities are instead of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù because that‚Äôs usually very domain specific and highly depends on the type of problem you ended up needing to solve.

A/B testing is a method where your user pool is segmented into multiple groups, allowing you to test different product interactions and understand how these changes affect user behavior. For any metric / data driven team, A/B testing serves as a critical tool in measuring success.

            <p class="desc">Every time there‚Äôs a major outage at Meta, the first question I get from friends and family is usually ‚Äúdid they fire the person who caused it?‚Äù which is where I have to explain this concept of No Blame SEV Culture. Especially for an outage so big that a significant number of users are affected, the individual causing it likely does not have ill intent and there are likely multiple different processes and systems that failed along the way to get us here in the first place.

Code review is a really subjective thing where each team or even individual runs things very differently. However, a bad code review process can lead to bad code smells and unnecessary tech debt (just ask all the vibe coders out there ü´£). I will try my best to share my rather opinionated takes while explaining the reasoning behind each of them.

            <p class="desc">When I had the idea on the series about The Opinionated Engineer, I figured maybe that‚Äôs something worth setting up a newsletter service over. That said, after some consideration, I just thought that I didn‚Äôt need anything too complex and decided to roll my own because ‚Äúhow hard could it be?‚Äù. As far as I can tell, I think it‚Äôs working fine so far(?) and took me around one whole day to put the whole thing together from my couch. You can find all of it‚Äôs source code here on GitHub.

            <p class="desc">This piece is specifically more about Meta‚Äôs unique culture of ‚Äúposting‚Äù about things but I imagine it can be a useful reference on communication in general. Many people loathe this process and complain about how it‚Äôs just a lot of ‚Äúself-promotion‚Äù and while there‚Äôs definitely some truth to it, it‚Äôs also a valuable communication avenue that you can leverage to your advantage. As we will explore further below, posting by itself is more of a bonus as the post will still require actual substance (which is your work lol).

            <p class="row subtitle">Move faster by moving slower</p>
            <p class="desc">Conventional wisdom is that writing tests slows you down, because the alternative is that you don‚Äôt need to write tests. In fact, Meta (then Facebook) was famously lacking of automated test inline with it‚Äôs famous ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù mantra. However, from what I‚Äôve seen, I beg to differ.

Just wanted to take a bit of time to acknowledge that it‚Äôs been almost 3 years since I last wrote a blog post. It‚Äôs been a busy 3 years for sure but hopefully I‚Äôll be writing more consistently moving forward. (I do have quite a few half-written drafts that I‚Äôve never published which I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs still relavant at this point.)
