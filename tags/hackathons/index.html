            <p class="desc"> Ask a programmer to review 10 lines of code, he‚Äôll find 10 issues. Ask him to do 500 lines and he‚Äôll say it looks good. - @girayozil
Code review is a really subjective thing where each team or even individual runs things very differently. However, a bad code review process can lead to bad code smells and unnecessary tech debt (just ask all the vibe coders out there ü´£). I will try my best to share my rather opinionated takes while explaining the reasoning behind each of them.

            <p class="row subtitle">Just a DB with some HTMLs</p>
            <p class="desc">When I had the idea on the series about The Opinionated Engineer, I figured maybe that‚Äôs something worth setting up a newsletter service over. That said, after some consideration, I just thought that I didn‚Äôt need anything too complex and decided to roll my own because ‚Äúhow hard could it be?‚Äù. As far as I can tell, I think it‚Äôs working fine so far(?) and took me around one whole day to put the whole thing together from my couch. You can find all of it‚Äôs source code here on GitHub.

            <p class="row subtitle">It&#39;s both self-promotion and communication</p>
            <p class="desc">This piece is specifically more about Meta‚Äôs unique culture of ‚Äúposting‚Äù about things but I imagine it can be a useful reference on communication in general. Many people loathe this process and complain about how it‚Äôs just a lot of ‚Äúself-promotion‚Äù and while there‚Äôs definitely some truth to it, it‚Äôs also a valuable communication avenue that you can leverage to your advantage. As we will explore further below, posting by itself is more of a bonus as the post will still require actual substance (which is your work lol).

            <p class="row subtitle">Move faster by moving slower</p>
            <p class="desc">Conventional wisdom is that writing tests slows you down, because the alternative is that you don‚Äôt need to write tests. In fact, Meta (then Facebook) was famously lacking of automated test inline with it‚Äôs famous ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù mantra. However, from what I‚Äôve seen, I beg to differ.
This is part of a series (The Opinionated Engineer) where I share my strong opinions on engineering practices.

            <p class="row subtitle">Strong opinions about engineering practice</p>
            <p class="desc">Historically, my personal blog has been mostly about ‚Äúhow to do x‚Äù, ‚Äúguide on making y‚Äù but never about ideology or engineering practices. This new series intends to change that where I‚Äôll explore the more opinionated side of myself especially around engineering practices instead of just the pure technical stuff.

            <p class="desc">This post will focus more on the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and some of the quirks around doing so instead of the ‚Äúhow‚Äù since GitHub already have a very comprehensive guide around it.
Just wanted to take a bit of time to acknowledge that it‚Äôs been almost 3 years since I last wrote a blog post. It‚Äôs been a busy 3 years for sure but hopefully I‚Äôll be writing more consistently moving forward. (I do have quite a few half-written drafts that I‚Äôve never published which I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs still relavant at this point.)

            <p class="row subtitle">Taking screenshots with Playwright</p>
            <p class="desc">A while ago, I saw this tweet thread from Simon Willison about how he added social media preview cards to his TILs. He detailed how he did this through a combination of Puppeteer, Vercel, SQLite, and some other stuff I didn‚Äôt understand üòÖ.
At that time, I was manually taking these screenshots by hand to be included as part of the commit, which is to say it‚Äôs not very efficient. Anyway, this stayed on my backlog of ‚Äúthings to explore‚Äù for a really long time until recently during this long weekend (where I also took additional PTOs), I had some free time and decided to look into this. The goal is simple, automate creating the preview images for a list of given / defined urls.

            <p class="desc">As time goes on in my journey of experimenting with different technologies on building a web interface, I figured it‚Äôs time for my personal site to return to the fundamentals. So I decided to build it with only HTML &#43; CSS with one of the goals being that it should work perfectly fine with JavaScript disabled.
Before this, it‚Äôs built with Vue. You can still find the source here.

            <p class="desc">While Vue 3 has been out of beta for quite a while, (as noted on their website) a migration build is still a work in progress so the current advice is to stay with Vue 2 if it‚Äôs a non-trivial project. I procrastinated on this article for so long that a migration build has since been released. Feel free to check it out here.
That said, as Parcel v1 is no longer maintained (and with v2 supporting only Vue 3), I figured it‚Äôs time to upgrade.

            <p class="desc">While the defacto way of running postgres on Azure Pipeline according to this guide seems to be using the docker image, the MacOS image on Azure Pipeline does not have docker support due to some licensing issue. So instead, this has to be setup and handled manually. We‚Äôd use brew here since it comes installed in the OS image and is the easiest way to deal with it as far as I‚Äôm aware.
