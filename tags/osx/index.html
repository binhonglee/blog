            <p class="row subtitle">Move faster by moving slower</p>
            <p class="desc">Conventional wisdom is that writing tests slows you down, because the alternative is that you don‚Äôt need to write tests. In fact, Meta (then Facebook) was famously lacking of automated test inline with it‚Äôs famous ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù mantra. However, from what I‚Äôve seen, I beg to differ.
This is part of a series (The Opinionated Engineer) where I share my strong opinions on engineering practices.
When to write tests? If you love something, put a ring test on it.

            <p class="desc">Historically, my personal blog has been mostly about ‚Äúhow to do x‚Äù, ‚Äúguide on making y‚Äù but never about ideology or engineering practices. This new series intends to change that where I‚Äôll explore the more opinionated side of myself especially around engineering practices instead of just the pure technical stuff.
Topics I have not fully planned out the entire series but here are a few topics I have in mind (or have released) so far‚Ä¶

            <p class="desc">This post will focus more on the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and some of the quirks around doing so instead of the ‚Äúhow‚Äù since GitHub already have a very comprehensive guide around it.
Just wanted to take a bit of time to acknowledge that it‚Äôs been almost 3 years since I last wrote a blog post. It‚Äôs been a busy 3 years for sure but hopefully I‚Äôll be writing more consistently moving forward. (I do have quite a few half-written drafts that I‚Äôve never published which I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs still relavant at this point.)

            <p class="row subtitle">Taking screenshots with Playwright</p>
            <p class="desc">A while ago, I saw this tweet thread from Simon Willison about how he added social media preview cards to his TILs. He detailed how he did this through a combination of Puppeteer, Vercel, SQLite, and some other stuff I didn‚Äôt understand üòÖ.
At that time, I was manually taking these screenshots by hand to be included as part of the commit, which is to say it‚Äôs not very efficient. Anyway, this stayed on my backlog of ‚Äúthings to explore‚Äù for a really long time until recently during this long weekend (where I also took additional PTOs), I had some free time and decided to look into this. The goal is simple, automate creating the preview images for a list of given / defined urls.

            <p class="desc">As time goes on in my journey of experimenting with different technologies on building a web interface, I figured it‚Äôs time for my personal site to return to the fundamentals. So I decided to build it with only HTML &#43; CSS with one of the goals being that it should work perfectly fine with JavaScript disabled.
Before this, it‚Äôs built with Vue. You can still find the source here.

            <p class="desc">While Vue 3 has been out of beta for quite a while, (as noted on their website) a migration build is still a work in progress so the current advice is to stay with Vue 2 if it‚Äôs a non-trivial project. I procrastinated on this article for so long that a migration build has since been released. Feel free to check it out here.
That said, as Parcel v1 is no longer maintained (and with v2 supporting only Vue 3), I figured it‚Äôs time to upgrade.

            <p class="desc">While the defacto way of running postgres on Azure Pipeline according to this guide seems to be using the docker image, the MacOS image on Azure Pipeline does not have docker support due to some licensing issue. So instead, this has to be setup and handled manually. We‚Äôd use brew here since it comes installed in the OS image and is the easiest way to deal with it as far as I‚Äôm aware.

            <p class="row subtitle">Component and Unit Testing with Test Coverage</p>
            <p class="desc">When working on a project with Vue (TypeScript), I faced a lot of roadblocks trying to get code coverage to work. The issue is largely covered in this issue thread. Most solutions / workarounds for that seems to revolve around changing the bundling flow with webpack. Considering my lack of familiarity with webpack (on top of my use of scss and pug in Vue files), putting together a webpack config that works for me turns out to be extremely challenging. That somewhat prompted me to move the build and test process away from vue-cli while starting to experiment with different tools that could work. One thing to note is that, I‚Äôll be using babel to handle TypeScript compiling / transpiling instead of ts-node as recommended from Ava‚Äôs guide.

            <p class="desc">I was working on a side project where I had the backend and frontend setup to run on different programming languages. As I was working on it, it started to bug me a little that I have to write the same object / struct and enum for each language in use everytime I introduce a new enum or struct. It can also be confusing / dangerous if I updated one side and forget to update the other.

            <p class="row subtitle">Developing with Please</p>
            <p class="desc">I recently started learning about Go to find out what‚Äôs all the hype about. So I figured what‚Äôs a better way than to build a project out of it? As I was setting up my machine and going through tutorials step-by-step, I was slightly annoyed by the fact that the development of Go projects are limited to inside the $GOPATH.
Personally, I have all my side projects stored at the top level of the computer. It might not be the best way to do it but I‚Äôm liking that I can see all my projects at one glance. I guess one could argue that you can soft link the folder into the folder inside $GOPATH and I would pretty much achieve the same effect. But it didn‚Äôt quite feel right to me, sounds like a really hacky workaround that might not worth the maintenance cost as I switch to a separate machine only to have to do everything all over again.
