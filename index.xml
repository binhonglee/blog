      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time there&amp;rsquo;s a major outage at Meta, the first question I get from friends and family is usually &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;did they fire the person who caused it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; which is where I have to explain this concept of &lt;strong&gt;No Blame SEV Culture&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially for an outage so big that a significant number of users are affected, the &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; causing it likely does not have ill intent and there are likely multiple different processes and systems that failed along the way to get us here in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of a series &lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-the-opinionated-engineer/&#34;&gt;(The Opinionated Engineer)&lt;/a&gt; where I share my strong opinions on engineering practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#process-over-people&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;process-over-people&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Process over People&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something goes wrong (especially something &lt;em&gt;really catastrophic&lt;/em&gt;), it&amp;rsquo;s usually a combination of both process and people problems. The difference here is that process is more deterministic compared to people. People have off-days, get tired, make mistakes etc. so it&amp;rsquo;s important to have a process (or automated systems) in place to prevent that. This can mean anything from adding more test coverage, lint rules against bad code patterns, and / or more alerts. It is however important to note that they need to &lt;strong&gt;maintain a certain level of quality bar&lt;/strong&gt;. As mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-push-fearlessly-with-automated-testing/#broken-tests&#34;&gt;the previous article&lt;/a&gt;, flaky / broken tests are tech debt, same goes for noisy lint rules and alerts. Too many noisy lint rules and alerts would lead to engineers disregarding them or adopting a &amp;ldquo;wait-and-see&amp;rdquo; mentality which is not ideal in preventing future outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/img/sev_review_trifecta.jpeg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-30-no-blame-sev-culture//blog/img/sev_review_trifecta.jpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#expensive-lesson&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;expensive-lesson&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Expensive Lesson&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting quotes I&amp;rsquo;ve read repeatedly (both within and outside of Meta) about people who caused outages is that they just learned an expensive lesson through that specific outage. Firing them (or letting them go) would mean that your company just paid that expensive price of such a lesson for an employee without actually benefiting from it. This employee will then bring this lesson with them to their next employer who would then benefit from such experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#fear&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;fear&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Fear&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more significant downsides of &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt;, is that you now instill fear in making any sort of production changes (even calculated ones). Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s important to keep in mind that as your product / infra grows, so should your process. Having strong fear in taking any responsibility for even attempting to improve or make fundamental changes breeds complacency. This can be fine in certain organizations and products (like government software, health tech etc.) where there&amp;rsquo;s almost no tolerance for any sort of outages. That said, this is where you should have good chaos engineering and fail-safe practices to ensure the resiliency of your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#no-blame--no-responsibility&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;no-blame--no-responsibility&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;No Blame ≠ No Responsibility&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of an exception or outlier effect (and likely the most controversial part of this whole piece). Usually when you cause a really major outage (or multiple for that matter), it&amp;rsquo;s really not your fault (or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be). But sometimes, smaller outages are understandably less &amp;ldquo;well protected&amp;rdquo; because we expect people to still &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; about the things they work on. If you &lt;strong&gt;continuously&lt;/strong&gt; cause outages due to &lt;strong&gt;recklessness&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;ldquo;lack of &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;) especially within a short period of time, you should still be held accountable for it. It&amp;rsquo;s especially common when someone chases the topline metrics movement against a tight timeline (end of a performance review cycle). This does not mean that people should be finger-pointing during the incident review, as before, that should be used to focus on what could&amp;rsquo;ve been better instead. However, it should be brought up separately as part of the performance conversation. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that this is a scenario where a &lt;em&gt;quantitative change leads to a qualitative change&lt;/em&gt; since an increase in quantity (of incidents) leads to a change in narrative thus should not be used to penalize those who&amp;rsquo;ve only caused one (or maybe two) incidents in a given period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, if there isn&amp;rsquo;t any runbook or recovery plan prepared ahead of time (especially for predictable issues - &lt;em&gt;*subjective*&lt;/em&gt;), it demonstrates a lack of good planning and foresight into the feature. This is - frankly - a lack of competence and the project owner should take responsibility for the rather &lt;em&gt;incomplete&lt;/em&gt; launch. However, the reality is that many individuals would launch buggy projects, claim credit for all the good it brings, while oncalls (spread across the team) pay for the lack of implementation quality. This is especially true when they immediately switch teams after project launches and no longer have to maintain or deal with the aftermath of their uninspiring launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No blame culture means that you aren&amp;rsquo;t fully responsible just because you accidentally touched the house of cards causing it to collapse. Instead, we need better protection around it - like building a fence around it, using LEGO blocks instead of cards, etc - to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t break down easily again after someone accidentally touches it, or just prevent people from accidentally touching it altogether. This means we hold those who are responsible for ensuring the protection accountable instead of those who inevitably discovered the problem. It&amp;rsquo;s like how we don&amp;rsquo;t blame white hat hackers for discovering an exploit; we pay them bounties as a way to thank them for discovering them. We should thank those who found holes in our system&amp;rsquo;s reliability instead of penalizing them for finding it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Code Review Culture</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-23-code-review-culture/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-23-code-review-culture/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask a programmer to review 10 lines of code, he&amp;rsquo;ll find 10 issues. Ask him to do 500 lines and he&amp;rsquo;ll say it looks good. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/girayozil/status/306836785739210752&#34;&gt;@girayozil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code review is a really subjective thing where each team or even individual runs things very differently. However, a bad code review process can lead to bad code smells and unnecessary tech debt (just ask all the vibe coders out there 🫣). I will try my best to share my &lt;em&gt;rather opinionated&lt;/em&gt; takes while explaining the reasoning behind each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of a series &lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-the-opinionated-engineer/&#34;&gt;(The Opinionated Engineer)&lt;/a&gt; where I share my strong opinions on engineering practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#overly-prescriptive-formatters&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;overly-prescriptive-formatters&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Overly prescriptive formatters&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m highly supportive of having a preset of an overly prescriptive formatter. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it&amp;rsquo;s spaces vs tabs, 2 spaces vs 4 spaces, curly braces on the same line or newline; as long as you have a formatter that keeps it consistent. This cuts down on all the unnecessary time reviewing and fixing code formatting while still being easy to read and scan through. Make them as strict as possible, ideally 100% reproducible where every line of code only has one way it can be formatted. Again, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter which style you pick but just pick something and stick with it, it&amp;rsquo;s all about consistency here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#bias-against-newbies&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;bias-against-newbies&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Bias against newbies&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some research that finds that when someone is new to the stack / team / industry, reviewers tend to be stricter and more nitpicky against their code changes relative to a long-timer or a more senior engineer. Personally, I see this as a feature instead of a bug. A long-timer has earned their reputation (assuming that&amp;rsquo;s how they are a long-timer and not just a bad engineer successfully avoiding accountability at every turn) and can be afforded to be treated with more leniency in their code. A &lt;em&gt;newbie&lt;/em&gt; however benefits from stricter code review feedback teaching them the style and tradeoffs the team values when it comes to coding patterns, thus learning good practices along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, teams would have detailed style guides on how everything is written and every new person will be given ample time to read and understand them as part of onboarding. But the reality is that this rarely happens between the outdated style guides and the lack of proper onboarding process, so code review frequently becomes the first time a new person has the opportunity to learn about a team&amp;rsquo;s style guide (aside from linters and formatters). Let&amp;rsquo;s make sure to get it right so they don&amp;rsquo;t develop the wrong habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that senior engineers should still hold themselves to a higher level in producing quality code as a way to lead by example. It will be rather unconvincing to a newbie if their reviewer writes &lt;em&gt;subpar code&lt;/em&gt; while holding others to a higher quality bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ask-for-further-details&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ask-for-further-details&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Ask for further details&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the change request itself is lacking details about the project or the reason behind such changes. Always ask for further details. In many occasions, it&amp;rsquo;s just the author overlooking it or making an assumption that their reviewers share the same level of context the author has about the project. This is a bit of an extension from the previous section but if you are accepting without understanding &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, you are in a sense &amp;ldquo;blindly accepting&amp;rdquo; the change (even if in this case, it&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; blind lol).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the change is too complex (or if it&amp;rsquo;s bundling too many changes at once), ask for it to be broken down into atomic changes for better / easier review. Having smaller changes also allows for each change to be better reviewed by different domain experts instead of everyone crowding on the same change request. (I understand this is not always feasible so there will be exceptions but ideally, this is done whenever possible.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#never-blindly-accept--accept-to-unblock&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;never-blindly-accept--accept-to-unblock&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Never blindly accept / accept to unblock&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are generally two separate scenarios but their result is generally the same. A change that is otherwise not meeting the code review bar is getting accepted and pushed to production. Blind acceptance generally reflects more of a bad team culture where people either don&amp;rsquo;t take code review seriously or they don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable pushing back in code review, both of which are bad. &amp;ldquo;Accept to unblock&amp;rdquo; generally comes with good intention but doing so essentially voids the role of a reviewer. The most common reason for its use is due to reviewers not feeling comfortable about blocking a change but not wishing to take responsibility if that ends up being the bad commit causing an outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; exception here would be when it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;time sensitive&lt;/em&gt; change where &amp;ldquo;it can&amp;rsquo;t be worse than it is now&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; that the author is the &lt;em&gt;domain expert&lt;/em&gt; of the change. The most common example being a code change attempting to mitigate an ongoing production issue. (I&amp;rsquo;ll write up an incident runbook at some point which will most likely include this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#fix-now-not-later&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;fix-now-not-later&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Fix &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt; not later&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some occasions, you might run into a response in your review that they will &amp;ldquo;fix it in a future change&amp;rdquo;. (Generally, it&amp;rsquo;s more common in scenarios where your work adopts the idea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphite.dev/guides/stacked-diffs&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;stacked diffs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.) This is a bad pattern that should be avoided at large (unless &lt;em&gt;absolutely necessary&lt;/em&gt;) mainly because this change now hinges on a separate future change to be &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt;, and that the other change could be independently reverted - for any external reasons - without this change, thus causing this bad pattern to now persist in your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#involve-the-subject-matter-expert&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;involve-the-subject-matter-expert&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Involve the Subject Matter Expert&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re tagged / asked to review a change but you think someone else should take a look too, tag them. Most people are very open to reviewing changes when approached directly (especially if they are the SME, the change likely affects them / their team directly too). I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of the number of times where I wrote some code, pinged the SME, then learned that whatever I&amp;rsquo;m doing is an anti-pattern which &amp;ldquo;works fine now&amp;rdquo; but has no guarantee that it will continue working that way. Funnily, I&amp;rsquo;ve even had an experience where the framework team pulled me in to review changes because I was considered the SME for the use case another person was attempting. In general, it&amp;rsquo;s better to have these discussions &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; a change is committed instead of &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; (especially if it ends up causing unexpected incidents later on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#prototyping&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;prototyping&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code changes that are meant to be prototypes (especially RFCs) should clearly indicate that in their title (or some obvious tags / flags). There are 2 types of prototype code, one which is more of an exploration that is never meant to be shipped; while the other is a recommendation for adoption. In both scenarios, there should be clear indication of which type of prototype code this is and what the intention behind the prototype is (what are you trying to achieve?). For the former - exploration that is never meant to be shipped, the change should also clearly mark that it should never be shipped (hidden / unpublished etc.) with little comments all over explaining each of the &amp;ldquo;mocks&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;overrides&amp;rdquo; done to achieve the exploration. For the latter - recommendation for adoption, the change should be reviewed as strictly as any regular changes (potentially stricter since it&amp;rsquo;s likely coming from a &lt;em&gt;newbie&lt;/em&gt; as defined above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#long-review-time&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;long-review-time&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Long review time&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a polarizing problem where your team either never heard of this problem, or it&amp;rsquo;s something your team is struggling immensely with. In some teams, the lack of proper &amp;ldquo;incentive&amp;rdquo; for doing code review has greatly reduced team velocity in shipping due to time taken for a code change sitting around waiting for it to be reviewed. While I&amp;rsquo;d usually chalk this up as an &amp;ldquo;incentive&amp;rdquo; problem, I personally believe this as a &amp;ldquo;lead by example&amp;rdquo; cultural shift. Usually teams / orgs better at this have more &lt;em&gt;technically driven&lt;/em&gt; high level ICs who do a lot of (strict?) code reviews themselves, thus fostering a good code review culture throughout their team / org. So in that sense, &amp;ldquo;be the change you want to see&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culture of code review is something very intentional and will take effort to both cultivate and maintain. The value of good culture however, is usually not something directly measurable (will write a separate piece about intangibles in the future). Having bad culture generally isn&amp;rsquo;t something immediately obvious nor is it something that can be turned around overnight, but rather something that&amp;rsquo;s simmered over a long period of time until it&amp;rsquo;s boiling, by then it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;too late&lt;/em&gt; and people are leaving in droves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Simple Newsletter Service</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-21-building-a-simple-newsletter-service/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-21-building-a-simple-newsletter-service/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I had the idea on the series about &lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-the-opinionated-engineer/&#34;&gt;The Opinionated Engineer&lt;/a&gt;, I figured maybe that&amp;rsquo;s something worth setting up a newsletter service over. That said, after some consideration, I just thought that I didn&amp;rsquo;t need anything too complex and decided to roll my own because &amp;ldquo;how hard could it be?&amp;rdquo;. As far as I can tell, I think it&amp;rsquo;s working fine so far(?) and took me around one whole day to put the whole thing together from my couch. You can find all of it&amp;rsquo;s source code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binhonglee/subscription&#34;&gt;here on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#existing-newsletter-services&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;existing-newsletter-services&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Existing newsletter services&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from Substack, pretty much all other services provide it with a &amp;ldquo;freemium&amp;rdquo; model where you are charged based on the number of subscribers (regardless if they are paid). Admittedly, I doubt my newsletter would get to that point (I try to not take myself too seriously lol) but I also didn&amp;rsquo;t need most of the things those services are providing. Not to take anything away from them, they all seem really useful if someone is doing that for a living, but I mostly write for fun and as a way to do some knowledge preservation (future self-reference) with the sharing part mostly being a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Substack, I didn&amp;rsquo;t look too deep into things and while they don&amp;rsquo;t have the best of reputation, their product seems to fit my use case best where I won&amp;rsquo;t have to pay anything ever unless I started having paid subscribers. That said, I thought I didn&amp;rsquo;t need something as fancy but just something simple that goes with my personal blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#design&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty straightforward design with a DB storing the email, a key (used in place of the email as an identifier), and it&amp;rsquo;s confirmation status. When someone subscribes, they get sent an email to confirm their subscription, which they can pick to either &amp;ldquo;Confirm&amp;rdquo; (where we update the confirmation status) or &amp;ldquo;Unsubscribe&amp;rdquo; (where the entry is removed from the DB). First reason to use a key is so that we know the confirmation or unsubscribe click is coming from the users&amp;rsquo; email instead of just people manually typing the link with someone else&amp;rsquo;s email as the param. Secondly, it prevents unintentional leak of the user&amp;rsquo;s email in address bar / browser history. Not necessarily a big deal but just not the ideal privacy design. (You could argue that &lt;em&gt;exposing&lt;/em&gt; the key that way isn&amp;rsquo;t great either but I&amp;rsquo;d imagine being unintentionally unsubscribed from &lt;del&gt;a&lt;/del&gt; my newsletter is likely a non-issue for most people lol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#python-core-library-only&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;python-core-library-only&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Python core library only&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is written in Python (with some HTML templates) without using any third party library. I can&amp;rsquo;t say this was fully intentional but I generally like to avoid external libraries unless absolutely necessary which in this case, it&amp;rsquo;s not. As for &amp;ldquo;why Python&amp;rdquo;, it was an arbitrary decision as I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing interviews with Python and sometimes feel like I probably should brush up on it&amp;rsquo;s syntaxes lol. (Kept having to Google random things like &amp;ldquo;split string in Python&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;define object in Python&amp;rdquo; is uhh, not exactly ideal while in the middle of a coding interview session lol.) I did regret on this slightly because this can&amp;rsquo;t be &amp;ldquo;compiled into a binary&amp;rdquo; where it can just be dumped somewhere to run by itself forever with some config files and HTML files. Instead, it needs the server to have Python installed and run the actual Python code. I&amp;rsquo;d prefer keeping and running only the binary on server but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for it being HTML / CSS only, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly an extension from my personal site and blog being that way &lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2022-01-31-rebuild-personal-site/&#34;&gt;which I&amp;rsquo;ve previously discussed about here&lt;/a&gt;. My personal opinion is that our growing reliance on JavaScript to do things had made us forget how powerful raw HTML and CSS could be in general. But also, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised at how maintainable this has made my site as a whole. No worries about vulnerabilities or chasing and rebuilding it on the next / new shiny framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#email-html-quirks&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;email-html-quirks&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Email HTML quirks&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, email HTML behaves mostly the same with regular page HTML but there&amp;rsquo;s a few things that didn&amp;rsquo;t work which I&amp;rsquo;d like to point out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button type=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; within a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form method=&amp;quot;post&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;var()&lt;/code&gt; CSS params&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;html {}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:root {}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;body {}&lt;/code&gt; selector in CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;:hover&lt;/code&gt; - I read that some email provider supports them but most don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; block (Gmail client specific) - Despite &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/design/css&#34;&gt;what Google says&lt;/a&gt;, only inline CSS is rendered on Gmail&amp;rsquo;s own clients*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript - expected to prevent XSS lol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried to include everything in the email itself and didn&amp;rsquo;t make any references to external files for CSS which I assume would likely be stripped off as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*The content of the email do remain so if you use a 3rd party client (like Mail on iOS) it&amp;rsquo;d render just fine but Gmail apps or web client won&amp;rsquo;t render anything in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credential-stuffing&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credential-stuffing&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Credential stuffing&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after I deployed it to the open internet (like within 48 hours), I started seeing weird traffic with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.threads.com/@binhonglee/post/DJ4rP3FyZsn&#34;&gt;random emails signing up but never confirming their sign-ups&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://shub.club/&#34;&gt;Shubham&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that this is a &amp;ldquo;stuffing attack&amp;rdquo;. I did some more digging and find that this is a common thing where bad actors would just randomly try (usually old hacked) credentials on your site to see if they work. In my case, my param is set as &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; so it&amp;rsquo;s likely super obvious that it takes an email. To be quite honest, I haven&amp;rsquo;t figure this all out but I added some secret key and some extra logging to track bad ips. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect but it seems to be doing it&amp;rsquo;s job so far (along the confirmation check) in blocking majority of the spam traffic from actually signing up. As to why this is bad, I woke up to multiple emails mentioning that my send attempt to certain emails were bounced 🙃, probably a bad reputation thing if my email continues to be bounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fun little experience and mostly a good opportunity to brush up my Python skill better. (Ironically, I ended up doing my next interview in TypeScript lol.) I&amp;rsquo;d imagine if I started having more, different, thematic series in the future, it might make sense to allow for segmented subscription / un-subscription but that&amp;rsquo;s work for another day. For now, I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I had fun building and writing this. Please subscribe below (or don&amp;rsquo;t lol).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Art of Posting</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-16-art-of-posting/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-16-art-of-posting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This piece is specifically more about Meta&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; culture of &amp;ldquo;posting&amp;rdquo; about things but I imagine it can be a useful reference on communication in general. Many people loathe this process and complain about how it&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of &amp;ldquo;self-promotion&amp;rdquo; and while there&amp;rsquo;s definitely some truth to it, it&amp;rsquo;s also a valuable communication avenue that you can leverage to your advantage. As we will explore further below, &lt;em&gt;posting&lt;/em&gt; by itself is more of a bonus as the post will still require actual substance (which is &lt;em&gt;your work&lt;/em&gt; lol).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of a series &lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-the-opinionated-engineer/&#34;&gt;(The Opinionated Engineer)&lt;/a&gt; where I share my strong opinions on engineering practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#proposing-an-idea&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;proposing-an-idea&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Proposing an idea&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme of complaints you might see in a work environment is how &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; steals your idea. Making a post serves as a paper-trail on this being &lt;em&gt;your idea&lt;/em&gt; as the original author. It&amp;rsquo;s also a useful cross-referencing tool when you run into discussions where your (previously suggested) idea could be a solution, you can share a link instead of going through your idea all over again. By itself, it also serves as a valuable RFC where others are free to comment with their concerns and / or how they feel about things in general. From there, you could gather feedback or even retool your idea a little to eventually become a valuable proposal and contribution towards your team goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#tracking-progress&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;tracking-progress&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Tracking progress&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working on a long running project (especially one involving many different people in different stages), posts serve as a good way to track and announce progress, signaling to others if / when they need to start getting involved or otherwise. It&amp;rsquo;s also a valuable communication tool where others can keep track of your project if it ended up affecting their own project (intentionally or otherwise). One of the more common &amp;ldquo;behavioral&amp;rdquo; gap issue for an E4 -&amp;gt; E5 promo is where an E4 can quietly work through the project and launch everything themselves while an E5 would communicate this clearly (outwardly) before even starting to ensure that their project does not end up conflicting with the timeline of other partner teams unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrapping-up-a-project&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-up-a-project&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrapping up a project&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times (especially on a long running complex project) by the time it comes to &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; closing out the project, everyone is exhausted and you&amp;rsquo;re just glad that &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s done&amp;rdquo; and you can finally move on to the next thing. This is frequently a missed opportunity to nicely wrap up the project and show your appreciation towards everyone who helped make it happen. It&amp;rsquo;s like you went through all the trouble picking the perfect gift, understanding which variant fits them best, finding where to get one, but didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to wrap the gift in a wrapper or a nice little gift bag. Nothing wrong with it, and the value of the gift is still good but having a nice wrapper or even just a little ribbon would&amp;rsquo;ve been a cherry on top of the perfect gift. Similarly, making a post wrapping up the launch and sending thanks to everyone who supported the launch goes a long way in terms of both visibility and relationship building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all projects are straight up successful launches and / or without leftover cleanup work to do. In fact most projects have some level of cleanup work remaining after it&amp;rsquo;s launched. The wrap up post is the best time to clearly lay them out and at least ensure that they are tracked. Similarly, you might have learnings from the project &lt;em&gt;(especially for failed launches)&lt;/em&gt; which can be useful to share for future references if someone were to run into similar issues or to re-attempt this project again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#calling-out-potential-issues&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;calling-out-potential-issues&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Calling out potential issues&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly this section kinda feels like just spelling out &amp;ldquo;regular social interactions&amp;rdquo; but sometimes it just needs to be said. Both as an author or as a reader of a post, you should take the opportunity to raise any potential issue you might be concern about in the comment of the post. As an author, this allows you to essentially crowdsource potential solution to your concern (maybe someone else has a &amp;ldquo;solution looking for a problem&amp;rdquo; lol). As a reader, you might have different perspective that sees potential risks that the author might have missed, or they figured it out but made an assumption that others would know, your question allows them to clarify their thought process or solution to your question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are some exception where if you think something is not suitable to be discussed in such an &lt;strong&gt;open&lt;/strong&gt; setting but that&amp;rsquo;s largely up to your own discretion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#pre-read-from-subject-matter-experts&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-read-from-subject-matter-experts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Pre-read from Subject Matter Experts&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have an idea on stuff you might not be super familiar with (or at least not something you&amp;rsquo;re seen as an expert) and that&amp;rsquo;s fine. But it can be valuable to leverage people around you for their expert opinion. It&amp;rsquo;s also a great way to build work relationship as people like to be seen as an expert. I&amp;rsquo;ve largely found most people to be helpful and open to help look at whatever you&amp;rsquo;ve written as long as you have some level of relationship with them (be it working on a previous project together or trauma bonding through SEVs). Having a SME review your post provides credibility to the things you&amp;rsquo;re writing / proposing and helps get your stuff attention from the correct stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this is less of an opinion piece and more of a &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;how I do x&amp;rdquo;) piece. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect this to change minds entirely on your take about how this is just a lot of self-promotion theatrics but I hope to at least provide a framework on how to use this to your own advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Push Fearlessly with Automated Testing</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-push-fearlessly-with-automated-testing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-push-fearlessly-with-automated-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom is that writing tests slows you down, because the alternative is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to write tests. In fact, Meta (then Facebook) was famously lacking of automated test inline with it&amp;rsquo;s famous &amp;ldquo;move fast and break things&amp;rdquo; mantra. However, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, I beg to differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of a series &lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-the-opinionated-engineer/&#34;&gt;(The Opinionated Engineer)&lt;/a&gt; where I share my strong opinions on engineering practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#when-to-write-tests&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;when-to-write-tests&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;When to write tests?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you love something, put a &lt;del&gt;ring&lt;/del&gt; test on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this quote as a good general guiding principle. You should definitely have tests for all the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; features. For all the additional features (or edge case handling), you&amp;rsquo;d need to make a decision / tradeoff based on how critical it is for something to work, and how frequent you might be changing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#fearlessly&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;fearlessly&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Fearlessly&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal of writing tests is to prevent regressions. Without automated tests, you&amp;rsquo;d have to rely on other (less reliable) ways to avoid regression. Having (non-flaky) tests makes it easy to consistently verify when / how a regression is introduced. With the right CI system setup, you can make sure that you don&amp;rsquo;t release new versions / feature that would accidentally break previously released features in an unexpected way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#assumptions--prerequisite&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;assumptions--prerequisite&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Assumptions / Prerequisite&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expectation here is that you already have a working CI/CD pipeline setup which comprehensively runs all your tests for each commit merges and deployments. Alternatively, if you have too big of a test suite to run (or too costly), you could instead only run relavant tests on each individual commits while running all tests for each deployment.  If there’s a test that failed before deployment, you could still bisect to find the blame commit that broke the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#what-about-manual-testing&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-manual-testing&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;What about manual testing?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue with manual testing is that you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you don&amp;rsquo;t know. You know your code change affects x and y so you test them both and they work as intended but what you didn&amp;rsquo;t realize was that it also breaks z entirely which you did not test because that was unexpected. Having an automated test means you&amp;rsquo;d just always run the test suite (within your CI/CD process) which would be able to catch the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#what-about-qa-testing&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-qa-testing&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;What about QA testing?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QA testing generally happens on a weekly or bi-weekly (either definition) cadence. At best, you can do them on a daily basis but depending on the scale or speed at which your team is executing, it might still be hard to narrow down the specific commit that is causing the regression. With automated tests, you can bisect through your commit history without having to worry about setup and cleanup steps (assuming your tests are properly written).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#why-not-just-write-test-for-everything&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;why-not-just-write-test-for-everything&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Why not just write test for everything?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world where the cost to write test is 0, this would be a prescribed solution and everyone will be adopting TDD (Test Driven Development) but instead, we live in a real world where writing tests cost time and energy so it&amp;rsquo;s important to pick and choose things worth investing on vs things that aren&amp;rsquo;t. Such tradeoff is subjective to the criticality of said system and how often the system might be changed / updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#broken-tests&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;broken-tests&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Broken Tests&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken tests are &lt;strong&gt;tech debts&lt;/strong&gt;. Either prioritize fixing them or delete them if they are no longer relavant. Keeping them around gives false impression on the state of the test coverage while potentially adds unnecessary operational cost in running these tests. Same applies to flaky tests. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d go a step further by saying that flaky tests are worse than broken tests because at least broken tests are deterministic (which is one important characteristic of a quality test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have working quality automated tests, you can push new changes fearlessly knowing that it won&amp;rsquo;t cause regressions on features protected by these tests. This allows you to move faster both in terms of thinking about and testing all the possible regressions your change might cause, while also saving time on root causing a regression (if / when it does happen).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Opinionated Engineer</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-the-opinionated-engineer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-04-the-opinionated-engineer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Historically, my personal blog has been mostly about &amp;ldquo;how to do x&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;guide on making y&amp;rdquo; but never about ideology or engineering practices. This new series intends to change that where I&amp;rsquo;ll explore the more opinionated side of myself especially around engineering practices instead of just the &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; technical stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#topics&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not fully planned out the entire series but here are a few topics I have in mind (or have released) so far&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incident Management
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2025-05-30-no-blame-sev-culture/&#34;&gt;No Blame SEV (Incident) Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major Incident Runbook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefighting Heroes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product Growth
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A/B Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product Growth Opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth Engineer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment Review Process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal Tools
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal Tooling Ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the Value of Dev Tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#where-is-this-coming-from&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;where-is-this-coming-from&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Where is this coming from?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was working at Meta, I would generally build an idea proposal (on how / what to fix) around an opinionated piece like this. It largely serves like a RFC where I can gather other (both supporting or opposing) opinions and concerns before proceeding to make sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve considered everyone&amp;rsquo;s perspective. The difference in this series however, I would focus more on exploring my personal opinions and why I feel strongly about them. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to decide whether it fits the bill for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#what-should-i-do-with-this-information&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;what-should-i-do-with-this-information&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;What should I do with this information?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not meant to be blind prescription (especially since your situation could very well be different from what I am / was going through) but rather as an extra perspective for consideration when deciding on relevant matters. As the title states, these are opinions with which you&amp;rsquo;re open to have opposing views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#feedback&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;feedback&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Feedback&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I don&amp;rsquo;t have comment feature setup on here but feel free to respond and tag me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://threads.com/@binhonglee&#34;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.lol/@bh&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m generally active and happy to engage in any discussions and / or learn more about any counter examples!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runners</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-04-25-self-hosted-github-runners/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2025-04-25-self-hosted-github-runners/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will focus more on the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; and some of the quirks around doing so instead of the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; since GitHub already have &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners&#34;&gt;a very comprehensive guide&lt;/a&gt; around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just wanted to take a bit of time to acknowledge that it&amp;rsquo;s been almost 3 years since I last wrote a blog post. It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy 3 years for sure but hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing more consistently moving forward. (I do have quite a few half-written drafts that I&amp;rsquo;ve never published which I can&amp;rsquo;t tell if it&amp;rsquo;s still relavant at this point.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#whats-a-github-actions-runner&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-a-github-actions-runner&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a GitHub Actions Runner?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically instead of running GitHub Actions (GitHub&amp;rsquo;s own CI/CD) on GitHub&amp;rsquo;s machines, you can run them on your own devices. Running GitHub Actions on your self-hosted GARs would not count against your monthly Action minutes (since you are not using their machines) and can be an effective cost saving alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#why-do-i-even-need-to-self-host-it&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-i-even-need-to-self-host-it&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Why do I even need to self-host it?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main use-cases is when you have private GitHub repositories so you only have 2000 included Actions minutes. While it might make sense for you to pay for GitHub Pro (which comes with more GitHub minutes), I didn&amp;rsquo;t find myself needing all other features that comes with it. On top of that, I happen to have a few old computers lying around so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d use them as ever-on GitHub runners. (So far, the electricity bill seems to be cheaper than paying for extra minutes or paying for any external equivalent CI service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#why-not-gitea-runners-or-other-self-hosted-ci-services&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;why-not-gitea-runners-or-other-self-hosted-ci-services&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Why not Gitea Runners (or other self-hosted CI services)?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I already have GitHub Actions setup so migrating to a different CI service will take additional effort while still having similar limitations (for free plans). That said, Gitea actions mostly allows you to reuse GitHub action yamls (with a few minor exceptions like artifact upload / downloads). I stuck with using GitHub instead of fully migrating to self-hosted Gitea mainly due to the way dependabot and / or renovate-bot is already easily integrated without needing yet another action to trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#linux-with-wsl&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;linux-with-wsl&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Linux (with WSL)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; old Windows laptop (almost 6 years old, but broken battery and built-in keyboard) which is still pretty powerful aside from the fact that it can no longer be used as a laptop. It really hasn&amp;rsquo;t been used in any meaningful way for a while now so I decided to do some cleanup then setup multiple instances of WSL (with the same distro for convenience sake). The one issue I did ran into was when we needed postgres running in the background. Generally, you&amp;rsquo;d use a docker image of it on GH action but you actually can&amp;rsquo;t have multiple copies of postgres running on the same device because it&amp;rsquo;d complain about port 5432 being in use. (I tried blocking port sharing between instances but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to resolve the issue.) Eventually, I just install postgres on every instance but they all just uses the service from the first instance (which occupies the 5432 port). So far, it has mostly been working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#macos-with-utm&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;macos-with-utm&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;macOS (with UTM)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, the only macOS device I own was a 2014 MacBook Air (which surprisingly still holds up&amp;hellip; to some extend). So when I decided to start building an iOS app for &lt;a href=&#34;https://globetrotte.com&#34;&gt;GlobeTrotte&lt;/a&gt;, I knew I needed to buy a new Mac device. I ended up getting a BNIB M4 Mac Mini from some dude on FB Marketplace (for like $500). That said, I slowly learnt the pain of an immobile dev device so I copped for a used M2 MacBook Air (also for around $500). With that, my Mac Mini is officially freed up to do whatever so I install UTM on it to replicate the WSL setup of having multiple VM running on a device. However, I quickly ran into storage limitation issue since I need at least ~50GB storage per instance in order to run iOS simulators with XCode on it. The main instance only have 256GB storage where more than half is already occupied with all sorts of things other stuff. So instead, I setup a HDD dock and tried running UTM images on them. For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth, it works but the experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly great. The whole OS moves really slowly / laggy but I guess if it works, it works(?). I am contemplating on getting an external m.2 SSD to see if it&amp;rsquo;d do better. Will update this section of the post if I ended up doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#pros&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Pros&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the obvious advantages of not having to pay for CI fees and repurposing your old tech devices, it&amp;rsquo;s also valuable to have a consistent device setup especially across dev and CI environment (so you know test failures aren&amp;rsquo;t due to some missing setups). That said, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anything else particularly stood out aside from the cost factor and the ease of use (and it being &lt;em&gt;quasi-industry-standard&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cons&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;cons&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, these are being ran on my personal devices at home so if my internet goes down, essentially my entire CI service goes down with it (which isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal). As mentioned above, I&amp;rsquo;ve also explored the option to host them on VPS but the cost (for a machine that can consistently run it) is really high. Lower tier VPS (like those available for $5/mo) generally have too little RAM causing it to freeze up a lot when running heavier operations (like e2e tests). Maybe I can bring an old computer to a friend&amp;rsquo;s / family&amp;rsquo;s house and run it on there but then you&amp;rsquo;d incur electricity bills at their place. (As far as I can tell, it&amp;rsquo;s not much but that&amp;rsquo;s generally not the way to treat people who trust you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this mainly to save money and hassle to figure out which plan I need or what CI service fits me best. I used to run my own CI service with &lt;a href=&#34;https://drone.io&#34;&gt;drone.io&lt;/a&gt; many years ago &lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2018-08-20-hosting-your-own-git-server-with-gitea/#droneio&#34;&gt;(which you can read more about here)&lt;/a&gt; but ran into the exact issue on VPS having rather limited RAM. Hopefully this setup can stay around for a bit longer and facilitate GlobeTrotte on &lt;em&gt;moving fast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automated Link Preview Image Card</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2022-05-31-automated-link-preview-image/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2022-05-31-automated-link-preview-image/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1300868423774212096&#34;&gt;this tweet thread from Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt; about how he added social media preview cards to his TILs. He detailed how he did this through a combination of Puppeteer, Vercel, SQLite, and some other stuff I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand 😅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, I was manually taking these screenshots by hand to be included as part of the commit, which is to say it&amp;rsquo;s not very efficient. Anyway, this stayed on my backlog of &amp;ldquo;things to explore&amp;rdquo; for a really long time until recently during this long weekend (where I also took additional PTOs), I had some free time and decided to look into this. The goal is simple, automate creating the preview images for a list of given / defined urls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#playwright&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;playwright&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Playwright&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I just mentioned above that Simon used Puppeteer for his implementation but I just recently picked up Playwright for another project (&lt;a href=&#34;https://globetrotte.com&#34;&gt;GlobeTrotte&lt;/a&gt;) and figured that it seems like the right tool for this. Also, Playwright has better TypeScript support in general so I decided to opt for Playwright instead. (If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, Playwright is built by the same team of engineers who built Puppeteer but has somehow all moved over from Google to Microsoft to build Playwright. There were some uhh interesting discussions about this when Playwright was first announced publicly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum code needed for a working version is pretty short. It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ts&#34; data-lang=&#34;ts&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;chromium&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;playwright-core&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;genRun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;chromium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;launch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;newContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;baseURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;http://localhost:1313/blog&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;viewport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;jpeg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;preview/automated_link_preview.jpg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#globetrottealtimeter&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;globetrottealtimeter&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;@globetrotte/altimeter&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I might want to use this in multiple places, I figured it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to create &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@globetrotte/altimeter&#34;&gt;an npm package&lt;/a&gt; for this so I can reuse it everywhere (with just some slight config change).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package itself is really just a CLI tool for now. First, create a json config file based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binhonglee/GlobeTrotte/tree/main/src/altimeter#config&#34;&gt;this doc&lt;/a&gt; (depending on what you want from these screenshots). Then, run &lt;code&gt;npm i -g @globetrotte/altimeter &amp;amp;&amp;amp; altimeter config.json&lt;/code&gt; and you should see the screenshots show up once the run is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Unfortunately straight up calling &lt;code&gt;npx @globetrotte/altimeter config.json&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as of now (unless you already have playwright installed before which can&amp;rsquo;t be guaranteed) since it won&amp;rsquo;t trigger the postinstall script to install playwright.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it can also be generated by including the package as a dependency, then import &lt;code&gt;AltimeterConfig&lt;/code&gt; from the package, set the variables, and write the output to a JSON file. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;dist/preview&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;writeFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;config.json&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then you can run it with &lt;code&gt;altimeter config.json&lt;/code&gt; and it will start taking the screenshots and saving them into the specified folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#meta--tags&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;meta--tags&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To actually make the images show up when your web page is linked, you need to add the appropriate meta tags depending on which social media you want the image to be fetched and displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#open-graph-protocol&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;open-graph-protocol&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Open Graph Protocol&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ogp.me/&#34;&gt;Open Graph Protocol&lt;/a&gt; is used on many web services (including Facebook, LinkedIn, Mastodon) to fetch the preview image so you need to add the followings onto your site within the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. You can also (optionally) specify the image width and height. From my personal experience, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if they are absolute or relative path as they seem to work either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#twitter&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has its &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/markup&#34;&gt;own documentation&lt;/a&gt; for the display card. At the time of writing, it seems like they only take absolute path, relative paths don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work as intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;twitter:card&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;summary_large_image&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;twitter:image&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;https://binhong.me/blog/preview/automated_link_preview.jpg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator&#34;&gt;this card validator&lt;/a&gt; built by Twitter to try if your newly set &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags are getting picked up. Unlike just tweeting it out on your profile and see how it work, this would always force fetch from the given link and overwrite whatever cache they already stored of the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#google&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;google&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a good documentation on how to go about setting the image properly. I only found &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/robots_meta_tag#max-image-preview&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; about setting the &lt;code&gt;max-image-preview&lt;/code&gt; but nowhere does it say how to tell Google which image to use. I looked into how some of the news websites does it instead. NYTimes uses the &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; tag as below. The Verge seems to use some sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://schema.org/&#34;&gt;Schema.org&lt;/a&gt; setup but within a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag (instead of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and label it as &lt;code&gt;application/ld+json&lt;/code&gt; type. I also checked GitHub (since they actually do one of these screenshot as preview image stuff really well) but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag that stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;robots&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;max-image-preview:large&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;image&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;https://binhong.me/threads/preview/index.jpg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#github-action&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;github-action&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;GitHub Action&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently use the above package as a CLI on my own blog (specifically this one that you&amp;rsquo;re reading right now). I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to run a bunch of things manually everytime I write a new post before I deploy so instead, I &amp;ldquo;delegated&amp;rdquo; this part of the job to GitHub Action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the generated directory to .gitignore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Node.js in the GitHub Action (&lt;code&gt;- uses: actions/setup-node@v1&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the devserver site is up and running (in my case, &lt;code&gt;hugo serve -D&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npx altimeter config.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run build if needed (&lt;code&gt;hugo --buildFuture&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy! 🎉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you are generating this for static content, you might need to setup a server to serve up those static content on a &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; address. I recommend following &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/HTTP/servers/how-to-serve-static-files/&#34;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; to set up a server (instead of using &lt;code&gt;expressjs&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a fun ride. Honestly, I ran into a few problems here and there (mainly, setting up monorepo in GlobeTrotte and creating CLI with TypeScript) but it&amp;rsquo;s relatively straightforward otherwise. The actual coding part took less than a day while writing up the documentations (and this blog post) probably took close to double the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rebuilding Personal Site from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2022-01-31-rebuild-personal-site/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2022-01-31-rebuild-personal-site/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As time goes on in my journey of experimenting with different technologies on building a web interface, I figured it&amp;rsquo;s time for my personal site to return to the fundamentals. So I decided to build it with only HTML + CSS with one of the goals being that it should work perfectly fine with JavaScript disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before this, it&amp;rsquo;s built with Vue. You can still find the source &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binhonglee/binhonglee.github.io/tree/old_dev&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#design&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#inspiration&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;inspiration&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skip this next paragraph if you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in my old site&amp;rsquo;s origin story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old site is structured more like a resume than a personal self intro. It&amp;rsquo;s rather serious by nature since it was built at a time when I was looking my first job out of college. I stole the design from the personal site of a great friend of mine, Pat Pataranutaporn (just one out of the plethora of pages) and dulled it down a little. He rebuilt his entire personal site shortly after but I stick with it since I built it in a way that&amp;rsquo;s rather easy to maintain (as in adding and removing stuff overtime). It served me well during those times but at this point a redesign is rather long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t really do design (unless I&amp;rsquo;m given a rigid component library then maybe 😅) so I looked up how some of the seasoned software engineers design their site and pick out the parts I like about them. Here are some of the websites I took inspiration from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wongmjane.com/&#34;&gt;Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cassidoo.co/&#34;&gt;Cassidy Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joeprevite.com/&#34;&gt;Joe Previte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ideology&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ideology&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Ideology&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most obvious common traits among them is how minimal they are while still showing a lot of personality. The other being that 2 / 3 have a dark mode toggle while Jane&amp;rsquo;s site is dark mode only. I stick with these ideas and decided to be more playful with my text colors especially since I can&amp;rsquo;t draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other takeaway I had was that I really liked the monospaced font used on Cassidy&amp;rsquo;s site. I tried Victor Mono initially since I really like it (and use it day-to-day on all my text editors) but I find it&amp;rsquo;s readability isn&amp;rsquo;t great for longer paragraphs. I decided to settle for Fira Code instead (first font that introduced me to ligatures for programming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Monospaced fonts in general aren&amp;rsquo;t meant for regular text reading anyway so this is something completely within expectation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#implementation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Implementation&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#dark-mode&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;dark-mode&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Dark mode&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m not using JavaScript, this is going to be tricky. That said, major credit to Shubham for pointing out the basic concept of its implementation in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/4shub/status/1259298005368270849&#34;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of CSS gymnastics where I learn about the different selectors and what they each does in CSS (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element_pluss.asp&#34;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element_gt.asp&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_gen_sibling.asp&#34;&gt;~&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_attribute.asp&#34;&gt;[]&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important thing of note is that, the toggle &amp;ldquo;button&amp;rdquo; (the &lt;code&gt;detail&lt;/code&gt; component) has to be at the same level as the top level of the rest of the components on the screen. I keep my toggle on the right which is sufficient to prevent colliding / blocked by other stuff on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#smaller-screens&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;smaller-screens&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Smaller Screens&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried my best to make everything as modular as possible so it should properly reorganize itself dynamically based on the given screen size. However, there are always exceptions and this is where &lt;code&gt;@media screen and (max-width: 1000px)&lt;/code&gt; comes in handy for addressing these edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#dropdown-menu&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;dropdown-menu&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Dropdown Menu&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I add a few more sections to my side, I started to realize that the link menu might not fit on certain display sizes. In general, it just follows &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_dropdowns.asp&#34;&gt;this w3c guide&lt;/a&gt;. I originally did one implementation that used the similar idea of the dark mode toggle above but I opted for &lt;code&gt;:hover&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;[open]&lt;/code&gt; due to its interaction where I think it makes more sense to be dismissed when I tap on random places on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make it more accessible, it is also important to add the appropriate aria labels. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menu-button/menu-button-links.html&#34;&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; has a rather comprehensive guide on the proper labels to add for each fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#truncation-somewhat-unrelated&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;truncation-somewhat-unrelated&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Truncation (somewhat unrelated)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more for the blog part of the site where I find the default truncation being too lenient thus generating some of the overly long (and not uniformed) summary text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-css&#34; data-lang=&#34;css&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kp&#34;&gt;-webkit-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;word-break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;break-word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kp&#34;&gt;-webkit-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;line-clamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kp&#34;&gt;-webkit-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;box-orient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;vertical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#takeaway&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&#34;takeaway&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Takeaway&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall it&amp;rsquo;s been a great experience to relearn and understand what we can do even without any of the modern JavaScript frameworks. It also serves as a great reminder that web existed for quite a while before JavaScript came around. While they may not be as pretty and reactive as it is today, they still works and have a lot to offer (especially as HTML and CSS standards continues to evolve as well).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upgrading Vue TS Project (2.x -&gt; 3.x)</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2021-12-12-vue-3-vite/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2021-12-12-vue-3-vite/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;While Vue 3 has been out of beta for quite a while, (&lt;a href=&#34;https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/introduction.html#breaking-changes&#34;&gt;as noted on their website&lt;/a&gt;) a migration build is still a work in progress so the current advice is to stay with Vue 2 if it&amp;rsquo;s a non-trivial project.&lt;/del&gt; I procrastinated on this article for so long that a migration build has since been released. Feel free to check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/migration-build.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, as Parcel v1 is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel-bundler/v/1.9.4&#34;&gt;no longer maintained&lt;/a&gt; (and with v2 supporting only Vue 3), I figured it&amp;rsquo;s time to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#why-not-parcel-v2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;why-not-parcel-v2&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Why not Parcel v2?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually quite straightforward. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to try out vite for a while since I first saw it mentioned on an esbuild issue (asking for vue SFC support). I did consider snowpack for a while but I still decided to stick with vite seeing how its also created by Evan You and it seems to have mildly better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did initially try to upgrade the project to Parcel v2 seeing as &lt;a href=&#34;https://v2.parceljs.org/getting-started/migration&#34;&gt;how simple it was described as&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/4022&#34;&gt;I was wrong&lt;/a&gt; and instead of sinking anymore time into it, I decided to move onto something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#moving-onto-vite&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-onto-vite&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Moving onto vite&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing that really sealed it for me (with vite) was how simple the move turned out to be. I created an empty project with their template, clone the relatively minimal default config over, and it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;mostly&amp;rdquo; working. (Well, &amp;ldquo;mostly&amp;rdquo; because my project was still on Vue 2 instead of Vue 3.) Funnily enough, this was the same reason that led me to opting with Parcel initially since it needed very minimal configuration to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#vue-router&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;vue-router&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;vue-router&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the official Vue 3 guide, the way to call the router is to import and call it the &lt;code&gt;VueRouter&lt;/code&gt; you defined. This is slightly different from the previous version where you call &lt;code&gt;this.router&lt;/code&gt; to use it. Well technically you can still do exactly that, as long as you define router in your global properties like below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ts&#34; data-lang=&#34;ts&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;createApp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;vue&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;./App.vue&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;./router&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;createApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;globalProperties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, router navigation should work just fine but you might see &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;vue-tsc&lt;/code&gt;) throwing type errors saying that &lt;code&gt;this.router&lt;/code&gt; is of type unknown. We&amp;rsquo;ll fix this later when discussing about &lt;code&gt;vue-tsc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#vue-tsc&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;vue-tsc&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;vue-tsc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main upgrades that Vue 3 provides is &lt;code&gt;vue-tsc&lt;/code&gt;. On top of the regular type checking already available with &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vue-tsc&lt;/code&gt; also do type checking for inline TypeScript / Vue code in template (like &lt;code&gt;v-for&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;v-if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:props&lt;/code&gt;&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#volar-vscode&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;volar-vscode&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Volar (vscode)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do your Vue project development on vscode, you probably have Vetur installed. While Vetur works with Vue 3 projects, Volar is an upgrade to that comparatively as it uses vue-tsc and displays those new type errors inline. They do not complement / work with each other though so make sure you remove one before you install the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#shims&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;shims&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Shims&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;re not already familiar with shims, it&amp;rsquo;s essentially a type declaration file to tell your IDE what are the types of the vue file exports (and tsx files). &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54622621/&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s a stackoverflow question on why it&amp;rsquo;s needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#shims-vuedts&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;shims-vuedts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;shims-vue.d.ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the generic one that&amp;rsquo;d be generated when you create a new Vue project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ts&#34; data-lang=&#34;ts&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;*.vue&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;DefineComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;vue&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;DefineComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#shims-vue-run-timedts&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;shims-vue-run-timedts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;shims-vue-run-time.d.ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make router calls in your code with &lt;code&gt;this.$router&lt;/code&gt; directly, you might find &lt;code&gt;vue-tsc&lt;/code&gt; complaining about missing type declaration for it even if you already declared &lt;code&gt;app.use(router);&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;main.ts&lt;/code&gt; file. It seems like that doesn&amp;rsquo;t inherit the types imported automatically so you need to declare it separately for &lt;code&gt;vue-tsc&lt;/code&gt; to know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ts&#34; data-lang=&#34;ts&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;VueRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;vue-router&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;@vue/runtime-core&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;ComponentCustomProperties&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$router&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;VueRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you also call other stuffs similarly. As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s say you call &lt;code&gt;this.$notify&lt;/code&gt; with ElementPlus. You&amp;rsquo;d also include that in this type declaration file like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ts&#34; data-lang=&#34;ts&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;ElNotification&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;element-plus&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;VueRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;vue-router&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;@vue/runtime-core&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;ComponentCustomProperties&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$notify&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;ElNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;$router&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;VueRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for why I can&amp;rsquo;t just put these lines of codes in the same type declaration file as above, it threw me some error when I tried that. Separating them somehow solved the issue for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#indexhtml&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;indexhtml&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;index.html&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually this should just be in default state so the only change that needs to be made was to add this additional param of &lt;code&gt;type=&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the script tag calling the entrypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;module&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/src/main.ts&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#pug&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;pug&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Pug&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pug in Vue 2, you can have your whole block indented (kinda like the regular html block). But in Vue 3, it&amp;rsquo;s no longer supported so your outer most &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; can no longer be indented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are some bumps here and there but the process is relatively easy to understand especially with the help of new tools like volar (and faster compilation of vite).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PostgreSQL on Azure Pipeline with OSX</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2021-07-18-postgresql-on-azure/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2021-07-18-postgresql-on-azure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the defacto way of running postgres on Azure Pipeline according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/using-containerized-services-in-your-pipeline/&#34;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; seems to be using the docker image, the MacOS image on Azure Pipeline does not have docker support due to some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/2150&#34;&gt;licensing issue&lt;/a&gt;. So instead, this has to be setup and handled manually. We&amp;rsquo;d use brew here since it comes installed in the OS image and is the easiest way to deal with it as far as I&amp;rsquo;m aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#install-optional&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;install-optional&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Install (optional)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default postgres should already be installed in the included MacOS image but if you prefer to run it on a specific version you&amp;rsquo;d have to force reinstall the version you want just to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;brew install postgresql@13.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;Install PostgreSQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#multiple-versions-optional&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-versions-optional&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Multiple Versions (optional)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to test that it works with multiple versions of PostgreSQL, you can setup a version matrix for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;postgresql-11-10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;psqlVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;11.10&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;postgresql-13-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;psqlVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;13.1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then amend the installation part to make use of the value from the matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1

    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being installed by default, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t run by default so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add something like this to get the service started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#set-up-db&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s create a database called &lt;code&gt;db_name&lt;/code&gt; owned by the user called &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt; as password. (You can replace each of these with whatever that works best for you / your process.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#brew-optimization-optional&#34;&gt;

        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, postgres should already be working as intended but it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly ideal considering the first &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; call actually takes a long time since it&amp;rsquo;s also trying to run update and cleanup which can take a while. Considering that running brew update and brew cleanup probably has minimal benefit on a CI, we can add the following environment variables so brew wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#os-condition-optional&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;os-condition-optional&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;OS Condition (optional)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re including this as part of a multi OS testing config, you can add an additional condition for each line of the commands here to make sure it doesn&amp;rsquo;t run on other OS-es causing unexpected failures. Similarly, you can add its equivalent for commands specific to other OS-es.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#full-config&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally when put together, your config likely looks something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When working on a project with Vue (TypeScript), I faced a lot of roadblocks trying to get code coverage to work. The issue is largely covered in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/1363&#34;&gt;this issue thread&lt;/a&gt;. Most solutions / workarounds for that seems to revolve around changing the bundling flow with webpack. Considering my lack of familiarity with webpack (on top of my use of scss and pug in Vue files), putting together a webpack config that works for me turns out to be extremely challenging. That somewhat prompted me to move the build and test process away from &lt;code&gt;vue-cli&lt;/code&gt; while starting to experiment with different tools that could work. One thing to note is that, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using babel to handle TypeScript compiling / transpiling instead of &lt;code&gt;ts-node&lt;/code&gt; as recommended from Ava&amp;rsquo;s guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#babel&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;babel&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Babel&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use babel to help Ava properly transpile the Vue and TypeScript files. This is especially useful if you would like to get accurate code coverage for your tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how the &lt;code&gt;.babelrc&lt;/code&gt; should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34; data-lang=&#34;json&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;presets&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;@babel/preset-env&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;@babel/preset-typescript&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;babel-preset-typescript-vue&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;plugins&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;istanbul&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things to note here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alias set is optional. You only need it if you actually use the alias. You can also set multiple aliases or point it to a different directory depending on how your project is setup. Make sure you sync it with your &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; to prevent confusion / unwanted errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;istanbul&lt;/code&gt; plugin is also optional. This is only needed if you want to also set up code coverage with &lt;code&gt;nyc&lt;/code&gt; (more on this later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#setup-file&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;setup-file&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Setup File&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup file is there to set the test environment considering that these Vue component files are supposed to be ran inside a Vue instance with some preset, this file serve as a similar purpose but limited only to testing use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample &lt;code&gt;_setup.js&lt;/code&gt; where you can build on top of depending on what you need / use. See original reference &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/main/docs/recipes/vue.md&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;{}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the changes I made was to set &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; so you can also use it for the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to include this file in your &lt;code&gt;ava.config.js&lt;/code&gt; like below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;extensions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ts&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;vue&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;./src/tests/_setup.js&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;src/tests/**/*.spec.ts&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point you should be able to run your Ava tests as intended and it would work just fine. However, if you want to have code coverage for the project, read on on how to setup your NYC config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#nyc-optional&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;nyc-optional&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;NYC (optional)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons I started exploring for this option is to get good code coverage report. This setup allows us to let NYC generate proper coverage reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I wrote this piece based on my work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://globetrotte.com&#34;&gt;GlobeTrotte&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried my best to cleanup the code for it to be as reusable as I can. Feel free to let me know if there&amp;rsquo;s any issue with it. Hopefully you find this helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cross Language Object Parsing</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2020-08-09-cross-language-object-parsing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was working on a side project where I had the backend and frontend setup to run on different programming languages. As I was working on it, it started to bug me a little that I have to write the same object / struct and enum for each language in use everytime I introduce a new enum or struct. It can also be confusing / dangerous if I updated one side and forget to update the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I just wrote some shell script to automate this but it quickly become unfeasible. (Clarification: it&amp;rsquo;s still possible to do this, but without any sort of object oriented support, the code gets quite messy quickly and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to maintain that.) Now, at this point I should let you know that there are actually multiple existing solutions (Apache Thrift or Protobuf) that are way more matured, robust, and designed for use in a much larger scale. If you&amp;rsquo;re working on an enterprise level solution (or looking to learn something that&amp;rsquo;s more transferable into your future work), you might want to take look into them instead. I personally wanted something simpler and more flexible so I began working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh&#34;&gt;wings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#installation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have nimble (comes with nim) installed, you can install wings with &lt;code&gt;nimble install wings&lt;/code&gt;. As of now, the only alternative to that is to get the binary and place it in a folder included by the path (like &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/&lt;/code&gt;) which unfortunately means that it won&amp;rsquo;t automatically update when a newer version is released. I&amp;rsquo;m still working on (and learning how to) deploy it to more package managers for easier installation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#usage&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;usage&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Usage&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You write a wings file like the example below then run &lt;code&gt;wings &amp;lt;FILENAME&amp;gt;.wings&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;25
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;26
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;27
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;28
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;29
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;30
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;31
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;32
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;33

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  homeworks   []Homework
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  something   Map&amp;lt;str,str&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ts-func(
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  public addHomework(hw: Homework): void {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    this.Homeworks.push(hw);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, not only does it support generating files based on given specific parameters, it also supports importing other wings files directly which will also be generated by wings (unless specified otherwise in your config file).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#library&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;library&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Library&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s very beginning, wings has been published on nimble as a library for nim. With this, you will be able to make further customizations by importing it as a library especially if you only want to use a specific part of it. From there, you can even use build tools to incorporate it as part of your workflow if supported. (Shameless plug, I wrote the PR for please&amp;rsquo;s basic &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thought-machine/pleasings/pull/29&#34;&gt;nim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thought-machine/pleasings/pull/31&#34;&gt;nimble&lt;/a&gt; support through pleasings. Though admittedly it isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as complete as you can see here I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binhonglee/wings/blob/devel/build_defs/nim/nim.build_defs&#34;&gt;my own version of the config&lt;/a&gt; in the repo.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also created &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binhonglee/stones&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;stones&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a separate library that contains some generic functions and tools used in wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#generated-files&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;generated-files&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Generated Files&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#struct&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;struct&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh/#struct&#34;&gt;Struct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the afromentioned existing alternatives, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the way the data was stored and transferred. You&amp;rsquo;ll still be converting them from and to JSON and communicate through JSON (so they will still be human readable). Therefore, comparatively, it will be &amp;ldquo;slower&amp;rdquo; than the alternatives as it will inherit the same &amp;ldquo;slowness&amp;rdquo; of JSON (depending on how it is serialized and deserialized in each individual languages) and bulkiness (it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty well established fact that JSON string takes more space in memory than something like a serialized thrift object).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#enum&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;enum&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh/#enum&#34;&gt;Enum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing much about them. They&amp;rsquo;re just normal enums that starts from 0 and increment by 1 for each element in it. Custom type and initialization is in the works and might change up the syntax a little when support is added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#util-classes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;util-classes&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Util Classes&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the generated files (generally) work out of the box, they by themselves are still lacking of certain features that can be applied across all Struct or Enum classes. This is where the util classes comes in. They are written in each of their respective targeted languages as a package / library. Currently, there&amp;rsquo;s only a Util class for TypeScript since golang already have all the features in the util class baked in with its JSON support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#config&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;config&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh/config/&#34;&gt;Config&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the use of a config file is optional, its also where the core value &amp;ldquo;customizable&amp;rdquo; comes from. Config files are accpeted in JSON format and should be added as an argument when calling wings with &lt;code&gt;-c:&amp;lt;CONFIG.json&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Some of the more simple / straightforward configurable value includes things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh/config/#logging-int&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;logging&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which controls the verbosity of the output message in the terminal, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh/config/#skipimport-bool&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;skipImport&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which lets you dictate if you&amp;rsquo;d want to also generate imported files or skip doing so, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh/config/#header-str&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;header&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which lets you specify your customized the header comment for all the generated files. On top of that, you can also configure how you want the output files to be formatted by specifying your own templates in &lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh/config/#langconfigs-str&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;langConfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#template&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;template&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh/template/&#34;&gt;Template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, you can also write your own or import someone else&amp;rsquo;s templates (with &lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh/experimental/#remote-template&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;remoteLangConfigs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to configure the output files in your own format or even to output to languages that are not officially supported. This allows wings to be used in a more dynamic way both in terms of range of supported languages and style format instead of being limited by what&amp;rsquo;s officially supported (like in Thrift and protobuf though they do already have a wide range of support).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#takeaways&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;takeaways&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think one of the main takeaway is that if there&amp;rsquo;s already an actively maintained existing solution, it&amp;rsquo;s probably better to use that than to create your own. By now you might have realizes that this project is slowly morphing into something that looks similar to the existing alternatives but in a much simpler form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&amp;rsquo;ve only started learning about how a programming language is written only after a few months into the project so the design and structure is not ideal. However, since this is also much simpler compared to a full blown programming language, I can still get away with it on this. That said, I might start to incorporate some of these principles into wings as I continue to work on it (including writing a proper lexer and parser for it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just a little side project spawn off of another side project. There&amp;rsquo;s also the long time dilemma of &amp;ldquo;should I just write them manually or do I need to write codes (or use an external library) to write them&amp;rdquo; (the NIH syndrome). In this case the later took way more time than the former, but this is a side project so it&amp;rsquo;s more about learning than meeting non-existent delivery dates anyway. I&amp;rsquo;ve also find it fun to have been working on the project so far and I hope you find this helpful. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about it (or use it yourself), check out the project website at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wings.sh&#34;&gt;wings.sh&lt;/a&gt;. If you like what you&amp;rsquo;ve read, I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate a star on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binhonglee/wings&#34;&gt;wings repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multi-language Support Build Tool</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2019-08-07-multi-language-support-build-tool/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2019-08-07-multi-language-support-build-tool/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started learning about Go to find out what’s all the hype about. So I figured what’s a better way than to build a project out of it? As I was setting up my machine and going through tutorials step-by-step, I was slightly annoyed by the fact that the development of Go projects are limited to inside the &lt;code&gt;$GOPATH&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have all my side projects stored at the top level of the computer. It might not be the best way to do it but I’m liking that I can see all my projects at one glance. I guess one could argue that you can soft link the folder into the folder inside &lt;code&gt;$GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; and I would pretty much achieve the same effect. But it didn’t quite feel right to me, sounds like a really hacky workaround that might not worth the maintenance cost as I switch to a separate machine only to have to do everything all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Note: Yes, I did eventually found out that you can now do development without being in &lt;code&gt;$GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;go mod&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I started looking into build tools that can do that. Admittedly, I intentionally picked something that’s not so mainstream (Buck, Bazel, Pants) and found Please. (The other part of me liked the idea of naming my run alias as &lt;code&gt;plz work&lt;/code&gt; because it’s mildly funny.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#build-tools&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;build-tools&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Build Tools&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is a build tool and why do we need them? In most occasion of a side project, you build and run each part of your project separately in a package of its own with only one (or two) programming languages each. In which you never needed to cross compile or compile multiple projects at once in parallel. Even when you do, there’s nothing that needs more than a couple lines of shell scripts to string them together since the performance gain through parallel compiling is not that significant if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this does not hold the same for companies that adopt the concept of monorepo. Instead of multiple smaller repositories, they host all of their code (which can be a mix of many different languages and requires many different build flows) in just a single repositories. In this case, different projects can also share the same library that is already imported and in use by the other project thus making sure that the imported library version is always consistent across all the projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick summary of why and why not. I’m not here to debate if you should or should not use a build tool or monorepo. I’ll leave them to the experts. I’m just here to share about the possibility of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-language compatibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not limited to any specific path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistently work across supported devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoother e2e workflow (if set up correctly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slightly steeper learning curve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be complicated to set them up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#installation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few pretty straightforward way to install it according to their &lt;a href=&#34;https://please.build/quickstart.html&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; though admittedly, you probably shouldn’t just run some random script from some random website online (but then again, compiling from source can be a bit of a pain) so that’s really up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Note: You mostly only need this installed to initialize the project. Others wanting to build / develop the project does not necessarily have to have &lt;code&gt;please&lt;/code&gt; installed locally for them. Similar to how Gradle works with &lt;code&gt;./gradlew&lt;/code&gt; on machines without Gradle installed, Please generates a &lt;code&gt;./pleasew&lt;/code&gt; file that can be ran as an alternative if one does not have Please installed in the machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#setup&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#build-files&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;build-files&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;BUILD files&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly the BUILD file syntax for Please looks very much alike (if not identical) to some of the other more popular build tools like Bazel or Buck. I don’t know of the exact name for it but it is very Python-ish. In fact, GitHub linguist’s &lt;code&gt;language.yml&lt;/code&gt; actually explicitly &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml#L4001-L4003&#34;&gt;classifies them as Python&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend checking out &lt;a href=&#34;https://please.build/lexicon.html&#34;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt; as they are pretty good in detailing the available fields and their purpose for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#external-dependencies&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;external-dependencies&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;External Dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most tedious part of the whole process. It makes you realize how much have you’ve taken tools like &lt;code&gt;dep&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; for granted. Unlike those other tools I’ve mentioned, you’ll have to manually list each and every one of the external dependencies (and their dependencies) properly so Please knows which to prioritize and how to build and manage them in the most efficient parallel way. Fortunately, this should be a one time thing as even if you consistently increase dependencies, chances are you already have the dependencies of the new dependencies listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#code-structure&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;code-structure&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Code Structure&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a lot of freedom here. While you might not want to go crazy and have your code all over the place (making them referencing each other a nightmare), you can afford to structure them slightly different from the conventional way since the build tool will handle the hierarchical setup for you. For instance, you can have your main go file 2 levels (or more) inside some folder unlike the usual top level requirements. Similarly, if you need some folders of multiple different programming languages to overlap in between each other, that’s pretty possible (though I would question the need for it and if there’s a rational reasoning behind it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#pleasings&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;pleasings&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;pleasings&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the built-in supported languages and rules, they also have an additional repository that is home to the rules that are not actively maintained / updated thus not being part of the core functionality / rule. These includes support for things like Android, Rust, Scala, Kotlin and even Nim (okay, I wrote the one for Nim so I’m just shamelessly sneaking it in here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#genrule--gentest&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;genrule--gentest&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;genrule() / gentest()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with pleasings, there’s a possibility where there’s something you work on (or need for your project) that is not supported. In my project, I’m also compiling Vue.js code for the web. In this case, I used a genrule() to build it with pnpm (similar to npm and yarn) and a gentest() to run its tests. While it’s pretty straightforward to do it this way, I’ve also effectively reduced the benefits of using a build tool since I’m mostly waiting on this one rule (and rely on pnpm’s build efficiency instead of Please’s) when building my entire project. Here is an example how I did mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;current=$(pwd)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;pnpm run build&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;mv &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;$current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;deps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;:pnpm&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Note: Please do have &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thought-machine/pleasings/tree/master/js&#34;&gt;some support for JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;pleasings&lt;/code&gt; repository in which you can use their &lt;code&gt;yarn_library()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;js_binary()&lt;/code&gt;. However due to the nature of node.js dependency hell nowadays, handwriting the &lt;code&gt;yarn_library()&lt;/code&gt; rules for all the libraries you want + all the libraries those libraries depends on and so forth will probably take forever. I also did not look too deep into this to tell if this would work any differently from just running &lt;code&gt;yarn install&lt;/code&gt; just by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#ci-testing&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;ci-testing&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;CI Testing&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other benefit of having a build tool properly set up is that it would be slightly easier (and more consistent) to set up your CI testing both in terms of testing environment and testing outcome. Of course, there are still some external dependencies like language version installed etc but for the most part, build tools would always pull fresh version of the new build regardless if there is a cached version on the machine (that might mess with the consistency of the test result).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#vscode&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;vscode&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;VSCode&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most code editors, their linter will rely on the env value of &lt;code&gt;$GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; to look for third party libraries used in your go codes. Since those libraries don’t live in there when building with Please (it is in the &lt;code&gt;plz-out&lt;/code&gt; folder inside your project folder), you will want to have a &lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt; file that points the linter to the right location consisting of the compiled libraries. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34; data-lang=&#34;json&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;go.inferGopath&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;go.gopath&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;{workplaceFolder}/plz-out/go:/{workplaceFolder}/plz-out/go/src&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;files.watcherExclude&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;**/plz-out/**&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Note: you will want to replace &lt;code&gt;{workplaceFolder}&lt;/code&gt; with an absolute path to wherever your project lives since the linter seems to complain about using a relative path as &lt;code&gt;$GOPATH&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this has been helpful in opening you up to trying and mixing different programming languages into your project. Why? To me, side projects are just experimental grounds for fun. If it sounds interesting enough, I’ll try and make it happen (or in this case, see if someone has done it and use their ready build tool).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binhonglee/GlobeTrotte/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the side project I’ve been working on. Thus far, its still not functional. It will most likely take another few months or so (depending on my progress and how much free time I have committed to this outside of work) before I can deploy a minimally working version of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional and flexible shell scripting tricks</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2019-05-07-shell-scripting/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2019-05-07-shell-scripting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its 2019 now, who writes shell scripts anymore? Am I right? Well, apparently I do. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#shell-scripts-vs-python-or-perl&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;shell-scripts-vs-python-or-perl&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Shell scripts vs python or perl&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some good arguments for that &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/796319/strengths-of-shell-scripting-compared-to-python#796343&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/what-is-the-difference-between-perl-and-shell-scripting-4175486499/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which mainly revolve around 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell exists in all Unix systems and makes use of system default features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell is an &amp;ldquo;interactive command function&amp;rdquo; designed to get user inputs during the process of running them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5725296/difference-between-sh-and-bash&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s an additional relevant reading about the differences between &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#arguments&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;arguments&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Arguments&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some occasions, you will need to pass an argument (or expect one) into the script like how you might pass a param into a function. In that case, you will use something like &lt;code&gt;$1&lt;/code&gt; for the first argument, &lt;code&gt;$2&lt;/code&gt; for the second. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of how it would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;The input message was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;./run_this.sh userInput
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;The input message was userInput.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The params are separated by spaces so if you want to input a string as a param that contains a space, it might need to be something like &lt;code&gt;./run_this.sh &amp;quot;user input&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; just so &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;user input&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; would be counted as &lt;code&gt;$1&lt;/code&gt; entirely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the occasion where you are not sure how long the user input might be and you want to capture it all, you would use &lt;code&gt;$@&lt;/code&gt; instead. In the following example, I took in the entire string and print them out word by word after breaking them into a string array according to the spaces in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;userInputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i in &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;userInputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[@]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;./run_this.sh who knows how long this can go
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;who
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;knows
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;how
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;long
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;this
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;can
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;go
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#functions&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;functions&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Functions&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have done any sort of programming, you should be familiar with the concept of &lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a set of commands / operations that you will be repeating over and over again. Instead of repeating it multiple times in your code, you can put them into a function. Then just call the function which effectively reduces the lines of code that need to be written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side note: If you don&amp;rsquo;t know already, LOC is a horrible metric for any sort of measurement in terms of programming. Don&amp;rsquo;t take this from me, take this from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/536587-measuring-programming-progress-by-lines-of-code-is-like-measuring&#34;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how a normal function looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Declaring the function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;doSomething&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Calling the function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;doSomething
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward and easy to understand. Now, here&amp;rsquo;s a few differences between functions in shell scripts and a normal programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#parameters&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;parameters&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Parameters&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to pass a parameter / use a parameter into a function in Java, you have to declare them in the function declaration. They look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;random String&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the shell, however, they do not require a declaration of types or names at all. Each of them is like a separate script that lives in the script itself. If you were to use a param, just pass it in and call it like how you would do it if you were taking in input for this script at the top level. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;doSomething&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;doSomething &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;random String&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar to above, if you want to take in everything, you will use &lt;code&gt;$@&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;$1&lt;/code&gt; since &lt;code&gt;$1&lt;/code&gt; would only use the first input (and &lt;code&gt;$2&lt;/code&gt; for the second etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions need to be declared ahead of where they are being called. (Usually beginning of the file before any main operations.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#return&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;return&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Return&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say we create a script like below named &lt;code&gt;run_this.sh&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;doSomething&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sb&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;doSomething&lt;span class=&#34;sb&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$output&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s run it and see what is being assigned to the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ ./run_this.sh
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;magic
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that instead of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, it shows &lt;code&gt;magic&lt;/code&gt; instead. This is because when you do &lt;code&gt;output=`doSomething` &lt;/code&gt;, it assigns the output message to &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; instead of the return value since output message is how you communicate almost anything in shell script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when does it make sense to use the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; call then? When you are using it as part of an if statement. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;doSomething&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; doSomething&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Its true!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-txt&#34; data-lang=&#34;txt&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ ./run_this.sh
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Its true!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, &lt;code&gt;return 0&lt;/code&gt; means &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; while &lt;code&gt;return 1&lt;/code&gt; meant &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in a traditional &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#multi-line-echo&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;multi-line-echo&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Multi-line echo&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when you need to print a multi-line message. There are a few ways to go around this. The easiest way is to use &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; multiple times like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;line1&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;line2&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;line3&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works but probably not the most elegant way to get around this. Instead, you can use &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF&lt;/code&gt; instead. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;cat &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;line1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;line2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;line3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that there should not be anything (including spaces or tabs) before &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to do it in an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement, it should look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  cat &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;line1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;line2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;line3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realize that even the messages itself are aligned to the left. This is because if you leave them tabbed, the output message shown in the command line will also be tabbed. Also, if &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; is tabbed, shell would complain about it and usually ends the script there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#flags--options&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;flags--options&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Flags / Options&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen some of the scripts or commands that comes with an ability to add flags (and sometimes arguments for the specific flag). Something like &lt;code&gt;git commit -a -m &amp;quot;Some commit message&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick example of how it looks like (I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to be as comprehensive as possible with the example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;getopts&lt;/span&gt; ac: opt&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$opt&lt;/span&gt; in
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        a&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;\&amp;#34;a\&amp;#34; was executed.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        c&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;\&amp;#34;c\&amp;#34; was executed with parameter \&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$OPTARG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;\&amp;#34;.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Invalid option: -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$opt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        :&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;option -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$opt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt; requires an argument.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;esac&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ ./run_this.sh -c
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;option -c requires an argument.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ ./run_this.sh -c abcd
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;c&amp;#34; was executed with parameter &amp;#34;abcd&amp;#34;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ ./run_this.sh -a -c abc
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;a&amp;#34; was executed.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;c&amp;#34; was executed with parameter &amp;#34;abc&amp;#34;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ ./run_this.sh -x
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Invalid option: -x
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the differences between option &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; is that in the &lt;code&gt;getopts&lt;/code&gt; line, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; has a colon (&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;) following it after therefore telling the program to expect a parameter for the option. Another thing to keep in mind is that the options need to be declared in an alphabetical way. If you declare something like &lt;code&gt;acb&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; declaration would be ignored and using the &lt;code&gt;-b&lt;/code&gt; flag would lead to the error message instead of the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; case in the switch condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#what-is-test-driven-development&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-test-driven-development&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;What is Test Driven Development?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, it means “Requirements are turned into very specific &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case&#34;&gt;test cases&lt;/a&gt;, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.” Basically, you would first have to write the test of the software/feature you are developing before you start working on the developing the software/feature itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few more articles on the benefits and why you should apply TDD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/mobile-quality/test-driven-development-d16fd216d45c&#34;&gt;Test Driven Development&lt;/a&gt; by Jan Olbrich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/test-driven-development-with-alexa-sdk-777f6b5e5486&#34;&gt;Isn’t TDD twice the work? Why should you care?&lt;/a&gt; by Navdeep Singh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few thing you might want to have set up or installed before getting started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;Amazon Web Service&lt;/a&gt; account (a free one will work just fine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/en/&#34;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt; (personally though, I prefer installing and maintaining it through &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/creationix/nvm&#34;&gt;nvm&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text editor of your choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#setting-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Setting up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new project folder (&lt;code&gt;mkdir project-name&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate into that new folder (&lt;code&gt;cd project-name&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialize npm (&lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow through everything as you prefer (if you don’t know what it is, just press enter and it’ll keep the default) except for test command:, put in node test/testflow.js instead. The command line should look something like the snippet below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you have node.js setup for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing
Shout out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/robmccauley&#34;&gt;robmccauley&lt;/a&gt; for maintaining &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robm26/testflow&#34;&gt;testflow&lt;/a&gt; that provides unit testing for Alexa skills. Here’s what the following commands will do :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone testflow repository into your project at the ‘test’ folder. (If this project is also a git project itself, I recommend doing &lt;code&gt;git submodule add&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a folder named ‘dialogs’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a file named ‘default.txt’ in the ‘dialog’ folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the ‘SourceCodeFile’ line in the cloned ‘testflow’ repository to point to the ‘index.js’ in the base level of the folder (feel free to edit it to your personal preference).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git clone git@github.com:robm26/testflow.git &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;mkdir dialogs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;touch dialogs/default.txt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sed -i &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;9c const SourceCodeFile = &amp;#34;../index.js&amp;#34;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; test/testflow.js
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the ‘default.txt’ file in the ‘dialogs’ folder, you should have the intents you are trying to test. The default in the testflow repository consist of the followings but you should definitely add some more customized ones to it depending on what you are trying to do in your skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;LaunchRequest
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;AMAZON.HelpIntent
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;AMAZON.StopIntent
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case where you are taking in variables through utterances, you can do something like this :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;DoSomething Input1=userInput1 Input2=userInput2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a deeper understanding into using testflow, I recommend looking into its &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robm26/testflow/blob/master/tutorial/TUTORIAL.md&#34;&gt;tutorial page&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/35eb8ae8-2cd8-4de7-86c5-97a1abc239b9/testflow-simulate-conversations-with-your-alexa-skill-code-to-ease-debugging&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by the author himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#developing-the-skill&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&#34;developing-the-skill&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Developing the skill&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don’t have too much to talk about on this topic. Here is some sample code of how a sample skill can look like. (Also remember to do &lt;code&gt;npm install --save alexa-sdk&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;25
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;26
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;27
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;28
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;29
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;30
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;31
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;32
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;33
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;34
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;35
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;36
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;37
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;38
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;39
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;40
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;Alexa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;alexa-sdk&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;alexa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;Alexa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;alexa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;registerHandlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;handlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

Say help for help.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;input1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;localeCompare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;input2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;They are the same string!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;They are different!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend looking into the official &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook&#34;&gt;Alexa GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; that provides all kinds of sample skills that you can work on top of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#deployment&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&#34;deployment&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Deployment&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#alexa-skill-kit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;alexa-skill-kit&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Alexa Skill Kit&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and select ‘Create Skill’. In there you should see options to ‘add intents’ and ‘custom slot types’. You should add the appropriate slot types and intents accordingly from above. After you are done with that, select ‘Endpoint’ from the side bar and select ‘AWS Lambda ARN’ as the skill’s service endpoint. Make a copy of the Skill ID as you will need it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#aws-lambda&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;aws-lambda&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an AWS Lambda function selecting ‘from scratch’. After that, you should have an option to ‘add trigger’ where you would select ‘Alexa Skills Kit’. Now in the configuration dialog, you should put in the Skill ID you took a copy of previously then select ‘Add’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, select back to the box that labeled your project name. There should be a ‘Function code’ dialog box appeared below. While you can definitely copy and paste your code onto the online text editor, there might be chance where the packages you have installed and used in your code is included by default. It is also possible that you have more than 1 JavaScript files for the skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you would select ‘Upload a .ZIP file’ under ‘Code entry type’. Locally, zip up all the JavaScript files along with the &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder then upload the resulting zip file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#submission&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;submission&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Submission&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are done, you can go back to the Alexa Skill Kit page, select the ‘Distribution’ tab and fill out the appropriate information before submitting your skill for review. Hopefully everything goes well and your skill gets published at the Alexa Skill Store!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#credits&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ask-overviews/build-skills-with-the-alexa-skills-kit.html&#34;&gt;Build Skills with the Alexa Skills Kit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2018-08-29-how-to-host-multiple-domain-names-and-projects-on-one-server/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I own multiple domain names, and each one hosts a different side project. For the longest time, everything that required ‘hosting’ was hosted on Heroku. But their free tier can be quite limited, it can also get costly quickly if you are paying for each separate project. So instead, I decided to explore putting all of them together using NGINX (recommended to me by &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmw.fyi&#34;&gt;Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#required-resources&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;required-resources&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Required Resources&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#virtual-private-server-vps&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;virtual-private-server-vps&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Virtual Private Server (VPS)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a virtual server such as DigitalOcean or EC2 by AWS. Personally I uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7358373&#34;&gt;Vultr&lt;/a&gt; (here’s the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vultr.com/&#34;&gt;non-referral link&lt;/a&gt;) which costs me about $2.50 / month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#domain-names&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;domain-names&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Domain Names&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to register a few domain names. Assuming that you probably already have them, make sure your domain names are pointing at the name servers of your VPS. There should be a DNS section in your domain name service dashboard where you can select “custom DNS” or something similar. If you are not sure what the nameservers of your VPS are, you should be able to find that info easily through a simple search of “nameserver” + VPS service name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#setting-up-nginx&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-nginx&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Setting up NGINX&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#installation-and-basic-setup&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;installation-and-basic-setup&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Installation and basic setup&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reference from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04&#34;&gt;How To Install Nginx on Ubuntu 16.04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following commands through SSH-ing into the VPS. It will install NGINX, set firewall rules allowing it, and set NGINX to autostart on boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get update
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install nginx
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo ufw allow &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Nginx HTTP&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo systemctl &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt; nginx
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#configuration-setup&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;configuration-setup&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Configuration setup&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default virtual.conf location should be at /etc/nginx/conf.d/virtual.conf. I recommend backing up the default file before making any changes. (If it doesn’t exist, you can just create it.) Edit the file to look something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;29

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;api.breakups.life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;proxy_redirect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8080/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things to look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;server&lt;/em&gt; block — Each of these should represent each different domain or subdomain in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; — This is the location where the (HTML) files are loaded from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;server_name&lt;/em&gt; — (sub)domain name(s) that should load these specific files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;proxy_redirect&lt;/em&gt; — in cases where you are redirecting a specific subdomain to an active server, you will want to add this and put the IP location after it. (For local servers, either &lt;em&gt;http://127.0.0.1:port&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;http://localhost:port&lt;/em&gt; should work as intended.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo systemctl restart nginx
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you are done, restart the server so the new configurations will be loaded and applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#cloning-and-linking&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;cloning-and-linking&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Cloning and linking&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now remember, since you have your directory pointing at /opt/htdocs/&lt;em&gt;websiteName&lt;/em&gt;, your initial thought might be to clone your projects into these folders. This can work, but it’s not ideal since many operations in these folders require root access to really do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you can clone them into your user folder or anywhere else like you normally would, and then create a soft link to connect the path to your repository folder. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git clone git@github.com:binhonglee/binhonglee.github.io ~/website
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo ln -s ~/website /opt/htdocs/binhong
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you are cloning a Node.js static site folder (ReactJS, Angular or Vue.js), you will want to install (&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;) and build (&lt;code&gt;npm run-script build&lt;/code&gt;) them. Then link the &lt;em&gt;./build&lt;/em&gt; folder instead of the base level of the cloned repository. (Similarly for Jekyll sites, but use the &lt;em&gt;./_output&lt;/em&gt; folder instead.) As for active servers, just make sure your server is running on the same port as it is listed in the configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#set-up-https-with-certbot&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;set-up-https-with-certbot&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Set up HTTPS with certbot&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Let’s Encrypt, you can now get free and easy HTTPS certificates. With the introduction of certbot, everything just got even easier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get update
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo certbot --nginx -d binhong.me -d www.binhong.me -d api.breakups.life -d breakups.life -d www.breakups.life
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just run the above for all your domain and subdomain names and certbot will take care of everything. If you were to renew the certs, you can run the following so the certbot will help you renew your SSL certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo certbot renew --dry-run
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#updating-everything&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;updating-everything&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Updating everything&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have everything up and running, you might be thinking, well there seems to be an awful lot to remember if/when I need to update something. Unfortunately, that’s kinda true, but we can always make it easier by adding a script that does it for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how one would look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;25
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;26
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;27
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;28
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;29
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;30
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;31
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;32
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;33
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;34
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;35
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo certbot renew
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;killall screen

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people (including myself) host their personal projects on a third-party free Git hosting websites like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc. While that is sufficient for most people, it is also pretty fun to have your own Git service hosted on your own domain name of choice. While I trust my fellow engineers at these companies, I am using this as a personally backup to those services if anything goes wrong (&lt;a href=&#34;https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/&#34;&gt;like GitLab&lt;/a&gt;. Though to their credit, they were able to &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/10/postmortem-of-database-outage-of-january-31/&#34;&gt;recover most of it&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#requirements&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really isn&amp;rsquo;t much requirements except for a working machine and a proper working network. Preferably, you would be hosting this on a Virtual Private Server (DigitalOcean, Vultr, Linode etc.). However, you can also mess around with it on your own machine (it takes and requires very little resources by itself) or even host it at home on a Raspberry Pi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#installation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Referenced from &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-from-binary/&#34;&gt;Gitea&amp;rsquo;s own documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a Gitea package in Debian&amp;rsquo;s contrib (which most popular Linux OS such as Ubuntu and Mint based itself on), it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem it was maintained by the Gitea folks themselves so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t advice using it. Instead, the instructions below will provide an easy way to just download and run it with binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#database&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;database&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a database to maintain all the information of user accounts and such. Gitea comes with support for SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL out of the box so you can pick either of those that you are familiar with to go with. Personally I picked PostgreSQL as I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to learn how to mess with one.
In your choice of database, you should create a user (preferably only specifically for the use of Gitea) and a database for Gitea. You will need to fill out these credentials later when setting up Gitea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#gitea&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;gitea&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Gitea&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gitea calls itself &amp;lsquo;a painless self-hosted Git service&amp;rsquo;, the setup is indeed very straightforward. Simply download and run it depending on they way you want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;wget -O gitea https://dl.gitea.io/gitea/1.5.0/gitea-1.5.0-linux-amd64
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;chmod +x gitea
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optionally&lt;/em&gt;, you can also verify the GPG signature of the downloaded file with Gitea&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;amp;fingerprint=on&amp;amp;search=0x2D9AE806EC1592E2&#34;&gt;GPG key&lt;/a&gt; for security purposes before running it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv 0x2D9AE806EC1592E2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;gpg --verify gitea-1.5.0-linux-amd64.asc gitea-1.5.0-linux-amd64
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To run Gitea, it is as simple as the following…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;./gitea web
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, it will be running on port::3000 of the device IP (http://localhost:3000/). In case you prefer running Gitea from source, they also have &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-from-source/&#34;&gt;specific documentations&lt;/a&gt; for that. I had a lot of troubles trying to set it up myself so YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#load-balancer-optional&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;load-balancer-optional&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Load Balancer (Optional)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Referenced from &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/reverse-proxies/&#34;&gt;Gitea&amp;rsquo;s own documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running this on a remote server (especially if you are also hosting a bunch of other stuffs), you will need to use a load balance (like Apache HTTPD or NGINX) to forward a specific domain to the port. Append your configuration file with the following as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#apache-httpd&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;apache-httpd&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Apache HTTPD&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;ProxyPreserveHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;On&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;ProxyPass&lt;/span&gt; / http://localhost:3000/

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#configuration&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open your browser and navigate to the wherever Gitea was hosted. In there, you will be filling out the database settings as you have configured above (for PostgreSQL, it should be on &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1:5432&lt;/code&gt;, not sure about the others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few things to look out for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Domain / Application URL&lt;/code&gt; - This is important to be set up properly as they are used for SSH and HTTPS connection when it comes to cloning and pushing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Disable Self-registration&lt;/code&gt; - Considering that you are probably setting this up only for your own use, you should select this option so random people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just sign up and host projects on your server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Admin username and password&lt;/code&gt; - Since you have disabled self registration, you should then set this up in here and use it as your primary account. If you are concerned about security, you can also use the admin account to setup a day-to-day use account so in case the day-to-day account is compromised, you still retain full control of the server through your admin account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#usage&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;usage&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Usage&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I&amp;rsquo;m using this as a backup to my projects hosted on GitHub and GitLab (project pages is an amazing feature) so ideally, I am mirroring most (if not all) of my projects. As part of being a mirrored repository, Gitea will periodically check the source repository for updates so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to manually sync them. That said, I have quite a few projects that I moved away from mirroring and I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about why below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#maintenance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;maintenance&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Maintenance&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case where your VPS (or Raspberry Pi) might restart constantly or so, it might be a chore to always manually start the service every time it is restarted. You should then consider configuring Gitea to run as a service (&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/linux-service/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/windows-service/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#droneio&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;droneio&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Drone.io&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about the topic of Git, its hard to stay away from CI. It is such a great idea of automation that saves so much pain and problem especially if it is a huge project that takes a lot of resources and hard to run the tests locally. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://drone.io&#34;&gt;drone.io&lt;/a&gt; which can also be self-hosted along with your Gitea server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#requirements-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements-1&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to have &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;docker&lt;/a&gt; installed in your machine as drone as a whole relies quite a bit on docker to work. The machine where drone is hosted will also require quite a bit of memory and processing power as running CI can be quite a chore for servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#installation-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;installation-1&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Referenced from &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.drone.io/installation/&#34;&gt;drone&amp;rsquo;s own documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, get the docker image for drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;docker pull drone/drone:0.8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, create a file named &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yaml&lt;/code&gt; and fill in the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;25
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;26
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;27
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;28
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;29
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;30
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;31
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;32
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;33
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;DRONE_SERVER=drone-server:9000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;DRONE_SECRET=${DRONE_SECRET}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;DRONE_DATABASE_DRIVER:postgres&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;DRONE_DATABASE_DATASOURCE:postgres://root:password@1.2.3.4:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few things to keep in mind in the file above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DRONE_SECRET&lt;/code&gt; - This is a secret string of your choice used for authentication purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DRONE_HOST&lt;/code&gt; - URL where this drone server is hosted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DRONE_GITEA_URL&lt;/code&gt; - Link to your Gitea server location (it can also be &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000/&lt;/code&gt; link)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DRONE_DATABASE_DRIVER&lt;/code&gt; - Database setup is &lt;strong&gt;optional&lt;/strong&gt;. In their &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.drone.io/database-settings/&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, they mention the setup process of MySQL and PostgreSQL. Though do note that their documentation doesn&amp;rsquo;t seems to be accurate at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/drone/docs/pull/360&#34;&gt;from my experience&lt;/a&gt; setting it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same directory run the following and drone will be running on &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8000/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;docker-compose up
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#load-balancer-optional-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;load-balancer-optional-1&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Load Balancer (Optional)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if this is hosted on a remote server, you will have to add the following with the load balancer of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#apache-httpd-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;apache-httpd-1&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Apache HTTPD&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;ProxyPass&lt;/span&gt; / http://127.0.0.1:8000/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;ProxyPassReverse&lt;/span&gt; / http://127.0.0.1:8000/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#nginx-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;nginx-1&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;NGINX&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#usage-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;usage-1&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, drone relies on docker not only for its installation but also running the CI itself. Each repository that you want to configure for drone should have to have a &lt;code&gt;.drone.yml&lt;/code&gt; file like below at the top level of the repository. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;4&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few things to pay attention to in the sample file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; - Drone supports any docker images available for download. You can look for available docker images at the Docker Hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt; - Like the scenario above, you want to test the project in multiple environments but doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to retype most of the stuffs, you can use matrix as a variable to hold all the different versions you would like to run tests on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;commands&lt;/code&gt; - This is the list of commands to run for the test to take place. You should also include installation of project dependent packages (such as &lt;code&gt;mvn install&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt; etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#personal-notes&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-notes&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Personal Notes&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#mirrored-repositories&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;mirrored-repositories&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Mirrored Repositories&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently from my own experimentation, adding new commits to mirrored repositories (which are read-only) that are mainly hosted elsewhere would not trigger drone to run CI. Therefore, if you were to run drone on your own server, you can either enable it directly with the origin of the repository mirror or push twice to 2 separate servers for every commit. I&amp;rsquo;m still looking for a solution for this so hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s a better way than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#memory-issues&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;memory-issues&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Memory issues&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these instances can take quite a bit of memory spaces to run. Personally, I am hosting this on a 256MB VPS squeezing it with a bunch of other stuffs I hosts. This actually causes an issue where the tests cannot be run properly. As seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://drone.binhong.me/binhong/LibrarySystem/3/3&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; log, it was just abruptly &amp;lsquo;Killed&amp;rsquo; and ended there and then with no further information. I am still working on investigating this but it is very likely due to the lack of remaining unused memory space on the VPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#static-ip&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;static-ip&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Static IP&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you are hosting this on a Raspberry Pi at home for personal use, you would want to set a static IP direction on your router. This would help make sure that when in your network, you can always connect to the device through the same IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#nginx-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;nginx-2&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;NGINX&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;I did not go deep into either of the load balancers in here as I am currently working on a separate piece that will focus more onto the configuration and use of NGINX to hosting multiple domain names and &amp;lsquo;servers&amp;rsquo;. Keep a look out for that!&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can read more about NGINX on my next post &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/2018-08-29-how-to-host-multiple-domain-names-and-projects-on-one-server/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#references&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Building a side project over the weekend</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2018-06-02-building-a-side-project-over-the-weekend/</link>

      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2018-06-02-building-a-side-project-over-the-weekend/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few months ago during my job search, I decided that I want to add some new skills to my arsenal (resume) so I went ahead to build a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.breakups.life/&#34;&gt;bill splitting webapp&lt;/a&gt; (and the month before, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binhonglee/dota2-random&#34;&gt;an Alexa skill&lt;/a&gt;). Granted, the backend was built weeks before during a hackathon (shoutout to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hackisu.org/&#34;&gt;HackISU&lt;/a&gt;), I’m just focusing on building the UI that makes post requests to the backend. In the process, I also ended up fixing some inherent flaws I left behind in the backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#idea&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;idea&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Idea&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be realistic. You don’t want to end your weekend with an unfinished product that would cause you to lose focus of work / study during the week because you &lt;em&gt;“really need to go back and get it done with”&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, you also don’t want to just straight away give up in your first few hours because &lt;em&gt;“it’s impossible”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases where the thing you really wanted to build is huge and complicated, try breaking it down into smaller pieces and maybe span it over multiple weekends. The point being to have a realistic idea of what to expect at the end of the weekend and achieve it while not mounting yourself additional pressure (and distractions) to &lt;em&gt;‘complete’&lt;/em&gt; the other parts of it during your work / study week that would jeopardize what you are supposed to be doing during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/img/sideProject2.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2018-06-02-building-a-side-project-over-the-weekend//blog/img/sideProject2.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#preparation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#plan&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;plan&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Plan&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be lying if I said I have a detailed plan of how long I’ll take to get each part done. I just draft up the most minimal version that I think covers the basic need and leave it at that. Don’t over dictate yourself that you don’t have flexibility in case something happened to be harder than you thought, which is almost always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick something you are not already familiar with. The best way to improve is to get out of your comfort zone. It’s also only a weekend long so even if that turn out to be something you dislike, at least you now have a solid opinion backed with experience on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#food--beverages&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;food--beverages&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Food &amp;amp; beverages&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a major one. Figure out how you’re going to get food supplies over the weekend that will reduce the amount of time you spend not coding. If you usually cook for yourself, just make sure to look for meals that takes little time to prepare and prepare ahead of time too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also do you even Soylent? (Credit to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/wongmjane&#34;&gt;Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/img/sideProject3.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2018-06-02-building-a-side-project-over-the-weekend//blog/img/sideProject3.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#process&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;process&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold yourself accountable. I’m not saying to reject every single invitation from your friends to hang out but be you have to be aware and be flexible of your schedule. If you are in the train of thoughts or &lt;em&gt;‘in the zone’&lt;/em&gt; to finish up one major part of it, let your friends or whoever you’re gonna hang with know slightly in advance. I’m sure they wouldn’t mind the slightly additional wait while you have a peace of mind out partying or doing whatever instead of subconsciously constantly thinking about what you would be implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it slow. The faster you go in the beginning, the faster you burn out. This happens a lot and everywhere. It can be overwhelming in the beginning so you slowly take your time to walk through things and watch some tutorials (YouTube is amazing) to get help on learning to build whatever you wanted to (especially with new technologies you never tried).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take frequent breaks. I can’t stress how important it is to relax in between. You don’t get maximum efficiency by rushing things, you get them by being in between too comfortable and too overwhelmed. Personally, I would take a break and go out for a walk and fresh air every 30 mins or so. This highly differs among individuals so you have to figure out what works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/img/sideProject4.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2018-06-02-building-a-side-project-over-the-weekend//blog/img/sideProject4.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Wrap up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get too hung up on the project. I’m not saying you shouldn’t be proud of it but the skills you obtained in the process will very likely to be much more valuable than that. As mentioned, you don’t want to feel obligated to come back and ‘complete’ the project in the future when you’re procrastinating while you actually have other priorities like project deadlines, homeworks etc. so its important to wrap up your project properly in a way that its a minimal product presentable but also something you understand that you can always add onto whenever you feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in an off chance that it blows up, congrats! For starters, maybe you can start thinking about how to monetize it? I don’t know (this has not happened to me). Maybe some guys at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1401833413216649&#34;&gt;I can handle the business side&lt;/a&gt; can help you with that. 😉😂 /j&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting started with Travis-CI</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2018-04-22-getting-started-with-travis-ci/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2018-04-22-getting-started-with-travis-ci/</guid>
      <description>&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#what-is-ci-and-why-should-i-care-aboutit&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-ci-and-why-should-i-care-aboutit&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;What is CI and why should I care about it?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI stands for Continuous Integration which as the name suggests, is an integrated tests that runs continuously on every time when someone pushes a commit (or mostly when opening a &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/&#34;&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why is it important, it automates the whole testing modules. Ideally, you would still want to test your changes locally before pushing them to remote but in some occasion where you forgot or the program requires a lot more resources than your current machine can handle, CI comes in very handy. That aside, if your project happen to have people wanting to contribute code, a properly written test with CI will help you in reviewing the changes and ensuring that the contribution would not break the build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#why-travis-ci&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;why-travis-ci&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Why Travis-CI?&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of CI tools out there (cricleCI, AppVeyor etc.) so why Travis-CI? The straightforward answer is that its the easiest one to get started with especially if you are already on GitHub. This is actually also one of its major drawback which is how tightly tied Travis-CI is onto GitHub. As far as I know, it is not possible to use Travis-CI outside of GitHub. That aside, if you host your projects on GitHub, that should be the least of your concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#setup&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, sign up at &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;, link your GitHub account and enable it for the repository you would like to implement this. Do note that this is only for public repositories. If you would like to do this for a private repository instead, you will need to sign up for &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/travis-ci-for-private/&#34;&gt;Travis-CI Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a file named &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; and add the first line with the programming language you used (unless its Android in which you would then write Android instead of Java).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c&#34;&gt;# (or cpp, android, node_js etc.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there’s also a possibility that running the test might require sudo access to the testing environment in which you would then add the following line above the &lt;code&gt;language&lt;/code&gt; line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;cpp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#testing-environment&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;testing-environment&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Testing environment&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you will only be testing it in one environment which means this will be a one liner of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;linux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in most occasion, we will be testing our software with a few different kinds of environment (at the time of writing, Travis-CI seems to only Ubuntu and OSX as seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Sometimes, 2 lines is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;linux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;osx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more time than not, you need complicated configuration for each one of them (especially when it comes to C++ projects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how the environment configuration for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/binhonglee/TicketingSystem/blob/master/.travis.yml&#34;&gt;one of my projects&lt;/a&gt; looks like (shortened):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;linux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;addons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;sources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;ubuntu-toolchain-r-test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;packages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;g++-7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;MATRIX_EVAL=&amp;#34;CC=gcc-7 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; CXX=g++-7&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;osx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;osx_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;xcode8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;MATRIX_EVAL=&amp;#34;brew update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew install gcc &amp;amp;&amp;amp; CC=gcc-7 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; CXX=g++-7&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#language-specificsettings&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;language-specificsettings&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Language specific settings&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some languages, it is a lot more complicated than the others due to the way their versioning works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#android&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;android&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Android&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most complicated one I’ve come across. It took a lot of tries and failure for me to figure out how it works. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/android/&#34;&gt;The documentation&lt;/a&gt; has also since updated which helps greatly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;extra-google-google_play_services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;extra-google-m2repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;extra-android-m2repository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#c&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;c&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;C++&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t specific custom configuration available for C++ like for Android above but due to the nature of its complicated OS configuration, you will need to import the matrix from before into the system before installing anything that might be needed to run the test itself. Therefore you will need to add the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;before_install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;eval &amp;#34;${MATRIX_EVAL}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#java&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;java&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Java&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Java, due to the differences between OpenJDK, OracleJDK and also differences from versions to versions itself (shoutout to OracleJDK 9 &amp;amp; 10), you might want to test your software with every version available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;jdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;oraclejdk9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;oraclejdk8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;openjdk8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;openjdk7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#python&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;python&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you can test your software or package against different versions of Python including the development versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;2.7&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;3.6&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;3.6-dev&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;pypy2.7&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;pypy3.8&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Note: Due to recent changes, seems like &lt;code&gt;3.7-dev&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;3.8-dev&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;nightly&lt;/code&gt; would not work as of now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#nodejs&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;nodejs&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, you might need to test your software with multiple versions or node.js except the differences between each version is not as drastic but there are a lot more versions comparatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;node_js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;node&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;9&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;8&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;7&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;6&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;5&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;4&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;lts/*&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By doing this, you will be testing your software towards possibly 8 versions of node.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#install-and-runtest&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;install-and-runtest&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Install and run test&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/&#34;&gt;specific documentations&lt;/a&gt; about the configurations for each languages, you will find that many of them has default &lt;code&gt;install&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; scripts but you can always overwrite them with your own scripts or commands like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;before_install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;./beforeInstall.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;./install.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;before_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;./preTest.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;./test.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Note:  if you testing in macOS environment and is installing any dependencies through Homebrew (including language dependencies in C++), you will have to do a &lt;code&gt;brew update&lt;/code&gt; before running anything brew related to prevent an error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#deployment&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;deployment&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Deployment&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you host your project externally while using your GitHub repository as your code control, Travis-CI can also help automating the deployment process. Depending on the service provider you use, their configuration can vary greatly from one another. Below, I included some of those that I think is the more popular ones. As you might have guessed, you can also deploy to multiple developers at once. I recommend checking out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment&#34;&gt;documentation page&lt;/a&gt; before implementing any of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;your-app-environment&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;pypi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;username&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;password&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;after_deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;./post_deployment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#code-coverage&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;code-coverage&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Code coverage&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with testing, I would also recommend using a tool to analyze your code coverage. It will show you how much coverage your test has over your codes (and usually, use cases). Personally, I use the tool called &lt;a href=&#34;https://codecov.io/&#34;&gt;codecov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#add-thebadge&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;add-thebadge&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Add the badge!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, the reason I was hooked up by this is because long time ago when I first got on GitHub, I saw plenty of repositories have the badge that shows if their build is &lt;code&gt;passing&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;failing&lt;/code&gt;. I thought that was really fancy and wanted one of those so I started getting myself to learn what CI as a whole is about and how can I make use of it. Turns out, its a lot more useful than just being pretty!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RESTful API with Spark Kotlin</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2018-03-21-restful-api-with-spark-kotlin/</link>

      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2018-03-21-restful-api-with-spark-kotlin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When speaking of building a backend API, the most common tools is either Spring Boot for Java or ExpressJS for JavaScript. Even for Kotlin, Spring Boot and JetBrain’s own ktor is the usual option to go with. But today I’ll explore into the less popular option of spark-kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer : I am not in anyway affiliated nor do I work at the project. I just simply stumbled upon it and started using it when working on a side project. (coming soon™)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#understanding-rest&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-rest&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Understanding REST&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already know or built a RESTful API, you can skip this part. There are already quite a few &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.looah.com/source/view/2284&#34;&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt; out there that goes into the specifics of what REST is and all the amazing things about it. So instead, I’ll just cover the basics (more like, that’s all I know about it). It’s the standard way of communication on the internet through HTTP. In the world of internet, the frontend web interface needs a way to communicate with the backend. While the frontend can say all kinds of things, they still need to declare a set of standard ‘phrases’ between them so the backend knows what the frontend is asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#setting-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Setting up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few thing you might want to have installed before getting started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maven / Gradle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kotlin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java? (not too sure but you’ll probably need it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optional) IntelliJ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#getting-started&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Getting started&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/perwendel/spark-kotlin&#34;&gt;official GitHub repo of spark-kotlin&lt;/a&gt;, here are the following things to include to use it for either Maven or Gradle. Personally, I’m using Gradle for this simply because I’ve never used it outside of Android Development. (Also, its the new sexy thing. Kinda?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;com.sparkjava&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;spark-kotlin&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;compile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;com.sparkjava:spark-kotlin:1.0.0-alpha&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-basics&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-basics&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;The basics&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what attracted me to use it over spring-boot. It just looks so much easier and straightforward comparatively. Admittedly, I’ve never used spring-boot for server development so I could be totally wrong especially if/when it comes down to a large scale application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#get-request&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;get-request&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;GET request&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Welcome to website abc.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s it! I could’ve just ended the article here and you can pretty much figure out the rest on your own. But yea, let’s explore into a few more interesting features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#post-request&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;post-request&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;POST request&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34; data-lang=&#34;kotlin&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;spark.kotlin.*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/checkExist&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;checkItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;checkItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Exists.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Does not exist.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;exist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//Some check to make sure given string exist
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For POST request, they work as easily too! All you need to know is that the request body can be retrieved with &lt;code&gt;request.body()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#more-fun-stuff&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;more-fun-stuff&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;More fun stuff&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#redirect-params&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;redirect-params&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;redirect(), params()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what if you want to have the same output for separate links? Well, you can just do &lt;code&gt;redirect(&amp;quot;/path&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. You can also get information from the URL through &lt;code&gt;params(&amp;quot;:path&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; tag. Something like this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34; data-lang=&#34;kotlin&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;spark.kotlin.*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/checkExist&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/checkExist/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Does not exist.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;exist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//Some check to make sure given string exist

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#instance-api&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;instance-api&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Instance API&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also have a separate instance API that is running on a different port or with a different setting than the static API simply by declaring it as a separate variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Page does not exist.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are a lot of more advanced features (such as session, uri, etc.) that I did not cover. Feel free to explore them on your own following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/perwendel/spark-kotlin/blob/master/README.md&#34;&gt;README of the repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here on out, I’m including some relevant but not exactly spark-kotlin stuff on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#dealing-with-json&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;dealing-with-json&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Dealing with JSON&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many (or most) occasions, both requests and responses will be in JSON format. Here’s where Google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/gson&#34;&gt;Gson library&lt;/a&gt; comes in handy. It is really easy to use and had a wide range of support. I put together a simple example below to show how it is and can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This is a Java library made for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/perwendel/spark&#34;&gt;spark-java&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/perwendel/spark-kotlin&#34;&gt;spark-kotlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server needs to be running on the background (in my case, on port 4567) for this to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unable to attach a request body for DELETE request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: As mentioned at the time of writing, the DELETE request is unable to attach any kind of request body to it making it hard to test your DELETE request. Personally, I use different URL each feature so I just redirect a POST request from the same url to the DELETE request and test it through the POST request instead. Not ideal, but it works for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#references&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>Being lucky</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2018-02-10-being-lucky/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2018-02-10-being-lucky/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, you’ve graduated. Now what? Oh right, still no job offer! &lt;em&gt;*panics*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an international student, I have come across hundreds of guides on “how to land an interview”, “how to get a job”, “how to solve DSA questions” etc but almost none of them were specifically written with an international student in mind. I’m not here to dismiss the quality of such guides but rather, to be an add-on (or plugin if you will), to help international students understand their challenges better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#youve-got-a-lot-more-to-prove&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;youve-got-a-lot-more-to-prove&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;You’ve got a lot more to prove&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, with all the hassle for potential visa sponsorship or even losing you due to the visa lottery program, you have got a lot more to prove of being worthy of that extra investment. If they can hire someone to do the same job without all that hassle for similar or even slightly more expensive prices, they would hop on that right away. It just doesn’t make sense financially to invest in you when you have a higher chance of deciding not to or not being able to continue working for them 3 years later (after training you from a raw talent to a solid engineer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have people around me who constantly complain about this. I do too sometimes but then I thought, I’m not ‘top of the class’ smart or ‘winner of multiple hackathons’ smart. Also, complaining about it won’t help your case. A job won’t fall from the sky randomly just because you complained hard enough. If you are just an average graduate (like myself), there is really very little incentive to think you are irreplaceable (technologically speaking) though that doesn’t mean you won’t be in 3 years time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/img/bl1.jpeg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2018-02-10-being-lucky//blog/img/bl1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;“Two books on a desk near a MacBook with lines of code on its screen” by Émile Perron on Unsplash&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#going-for-the-big-four&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;going-for-the-big-four&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Going for the big four&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big four in tech usually refers to Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple (or Microsoft). Of course, anything in this paragraph also applies to most of the larger tech firms. These companies usually don’t take ‘the need of visa’ too much into consideration (if at all) as part of their hiring process but they also have higher barriers of entry than the smaller or more traditional companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you don’t need to worry so much about your application getting thrown out immediately after you check the ‘will need visa sponsorship in the future’ box. That said, you will need to be better than an average graduate. Spend some time on HackerRank, build some side projects, diversify your skill sets and most importantly, building connections. In the ocean of resumes that companies like these receive every year, it is really hard to stand out. One of the easiest way to get to the front of the line is through referrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go on LinkedIn, GitHub, local hackathons or your local developer meetups to chat and get connected with some engineers or even product managers. In many occasions, they would be more than happy to provide you with a referral since it would also net them some sweet bonuses. Before asking for referrals, make sure to do your own research through the company job site and shortlist about 3 positions you are interested in. Depending on the company and its referral system, this will probably make the job a lot easier for the person referring you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#my-3-months-of-opt-unemployment-is-almost-up&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;my-3-months-of-opt-unemployment-is-almost-up&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;My 3 months of OPT unemployment is almost up!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular way of extending this is to look for a professor you enjoy working with to help with his/her research. Alternatively, you can also look for a local super early stage registered startup or open source organization that might interest you and volunteer to provide free (or paid with equity) work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the general consensus is to never work for free, you should be very clear with what you are getting back in return. For example, you might be interested in helping the cause of what the organization is working towards or that you really want to work with the CTO and learn from him directly. Things like this might become an asset (or as Cal Newport calls it, career capital) in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the requirement is to work at least 20 hours a week. Since you’re working for free in many occasions, it’s definitely possible to negotiate your hours and reserve the rest of the time devoting it towards your job searching effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-first-job-is-always-the-hardest&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-job-is-always-the-hardest&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;The first job is always the hardest&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take this from me. Take this from almost every other person in the industry I’ve ever met. Get an internship whenever you can! Even if this means you might have to go back to your home country or work on some shitty project. If you are like me, only realizing the importance of this in your senior year, start working on side projects or open source projects. Develop niche, specific skills and people skills. Few months ago, I wouldn’t have known that my experience in developing an Alexa skill (because why not?) would helped me that much in my interview. If you know you won’t be able to impress recruiters with your experience, grades or anything, you’ll need to make it up with something else. Remember, you’ve got a lot more to prove, more than your peers with no visa issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/img/bl2.jpeg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2018-02-10-being-lucky//blog/img/bl2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo by Michał Parzuchowski on Unsplash&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#being-lucky&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;being-lucky&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Being lucky&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky. I got a phone call from a recruiter asking me if I’m interested in this position. After taking forever to schedule an interview, it turns out the team needed a few more engineers (who knows about ML and speaks Malay ‘natively’) so I was pretty much hired right away. The job offer fell from the sky. It came from somewhere I least expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just me. Almost every time I come across an international student getting an offer for a position at a tech giant for the first time, its always about ‘I was lucky’ somewhere down the story. When people hear that, they rule out that entire story as anecdotal but I think this is a consistent pattern worth exploring. Everyone gets lucky once in a while, but are you ready when your luck strikes? If you aren’t, no matter how many final round interviews magically fall onto your lap, you will fail all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that if you are good enough, luck is irrelevant. That’s probably true. But then if you are that good, you are probably just sitting at home debating which offer to pick up instead of sitting here reading this piece of article from some random guy on the internet. It’s not just about being lucky, its also about being ready enough to fully utilize that moment of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#backstory&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;backstory&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lied, but maybe someone else could. If you didn’t know already, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lowyat.net/2017/145654/personal-data-millions-malaysians-sale-source-breach-still-unknown/&#34;&gt;Malaysia just suffered possibly its largest data breach ever&lt;/a&gt; with personal data of millions of Malaysians (including your full name, IC number, phone number and home address) up for grabs as long as the price is right. If you are not freaked out yet, you should be and I’ll tell you why. I don’t think many people understand how dangerous these data can be. I’m also honestly mildly infuriated about this. No, not about the creator of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sayakenahack.com/&#34;&gt;sayakenahack.com&lt;/a&gt; (hereafter referred as Keith) but rather how this whole thing panned out. I’ve mentioned before in private conversations with friends about my concerns on cybersecurity in Malaysia but never really gave it too much thoughts. Not until I discovered this whole fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, with the amount of telecommunication companies being breached, it’s fair to assume that anyone who registered a phone number with their personal info on or before 2014 have their personal information leaked. &lt;em&gt;(This was also the general consensus of anyone who had seen the raw data, I didn’t.)&lt;/em&gt; By the time you are reading this article, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.keithrozario.com/2017/11/sayakenahack-com-answering-the-questions.html&#34;&gt;the site should have already been taken down&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lowyat.net/2017/147967/mcmc-blocks-sayakenahack-com/&#34;&gt;MCMC blocking it&lt;/a&gt;. (This does not however, means that the data is gone. Plenty of shady individual everywhere still have a copy of all these dangerous piece of information.) I waited for it to be taken down before sharing this as I will cover an &lt;em&gt;exploit&lt;/em&gt; that can possibly end up producing some potentially damaging information with some very basic scripting skills (less than 1 hour of Googling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-true-risk&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-true-risk&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;The true risk&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I brought this up to some of my friends, their reactions were rather “Meh, I don’t have anything of worth anyway. Why would they wanna hack me?”. This is where you’re wrong. They don’t have to hack you, you’re ALREADY HACKED. As to what can they do with it? &lt;strong&gt;Identity theft&lt;/strong&gt;, basically THEY CAN BECOME YOU. With that, I mean they can apply for loans from banks on your behalf, register phone numbers (to run shady business) on your behalf, essentially enjoy all the benefits of being you without any of the drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/img/icImage2.jpeg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2017-11-20-i-could-become-you-tomorrow-and-no-one-would-find-out//blog/img/icImage2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Information obtainable from SPR website&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first read about the breach, I thought, &amp;ldquo;it’s been 3 years now, as long as you’ve moved and changed phone number, they pretty much &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; have your IC no. It’s bad, but maybe not as severe as I initially might imagined”. Could I have been any more wrong. If you are a registered voter and your IC no is fallen into the wrong hands, whoever this is can easily pull up your full profile (full name, home address) from the SPR website. And while doing so, every single device that this set of data goes through (router, ISP, some surveillance services, or even a MIM attack) gets to see all of these information as well since the site is not encrypted. (It’s 2017 and TLS is free!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#responses&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;responses&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Responses&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don’t think Keith’s approach is perfect (minor things like captcha, API dealing with non-existent query etc), I still think that is the closest solution available which is both informative (educational) and maintain minimal harm to the victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With MCMC shutting it down, I really hope that they are actually aware of the risk and provide a much better solution (considering that’s what their job is). To all the people out there calling this as a potential phishing, the website ask for numbers where you may or may not put in an actual existing NRIC and does not ask for anything else. If this person were to phish for NRIC, he might as well brute force the SPR website which comes with 100% accuracy and all your personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is Lowyat.net, no, the data is not in any way manipulated as it was simply &lt;strong&gt;masked&lt;/strong&gt; for the safety of the victims because as you said it yourself, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/23152/&#34;&gt;“the sheer amount of information on the site could subject it to abuse”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I think you mean raw data not the masked data. Now that’s just a cheap shot at the choice of words, I read through some of the threads in the Lowyat forum and it seems like they are working closely with MCMC to ‘fix’ this. Hopefully, we will see something soon. As for now, I still stand by Keith on the ‘rights to know’ for the victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#technical-considerations&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;technical-considerations&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Technical considerations&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feel free to skip this if you are not into the technical exploitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it has come to my attention* that the API allows easy data scraping. Remember I mentioned an exploit in the beginning? This is it. By knowing the birthday and birth state of an individual, it is possible to do a targeted background search through scraping with the API. While this approach might not be efficient if your intention was to do a mass scrape of all the data &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.keithrozario.com/2017/11/sayakenahack-com-answering-the-questions.html&#34;&gt;as mentioned by Keith&lt;/a&gt;, the limitation in place is more than enough for such targeted digging. I do not want to go into details but if you string all these information I mentioned about throughout the article together, you’ll easily figure out what I am talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this is less of a threat considering that if you are able to circumvent the captcha used at the SPR site with some sort of image recognition, its easily way worse than any kind of vulnerabilities Keith’s site can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*I didn’t figure this out, credits to this random person who wanted to stay anonymous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#after-thoughts&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;after-thoughts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;After thoughts&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m widely upset by the of public’s reaction or lack thereof. Anyone who got their hands onto such information can just show up and ‘become you’ figuratively tomorrow but you couldn’t care less? I guess I’m going a little too far with my fear-mongering approach but I really think the public awareness of such danger is at little to none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the whole Equifax fiasco in the US, I sincerely think this is an important educational opportunity for both the public and the government officials to understand the importance of cybersecurity. I&amp;rsquo;m in no way an expert (not even a beginner so to say) in this realm but the ignorance over such topic is hurting the well-being of not just any individual but the trust in the country. With no punishment in place for organizations mishandling such damaging information (that allows impersonation), how am I ever going to trust anyone, any company, with any of my personal details anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use Terminal in Windows with Style</title>
      <link>https://binhong.me/blog/2017-08-15-use-terminal-in-windows-with-style/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2017 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <author>binhong@binhong.me (BinHong Lee)</author>
      <guid>https://binhong.me/blog/2017-08-15-use-terminal-in-windows-with-style/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the Linux Shell in Windows was first released, I used it and didn’t quite like it. Fast forward a year later, I heard it is a lot better now (also the fact that my familiarity with terminal commands improved helped) so I decided to give it another try. It is a really fun experience so far. In case you haven’t install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), follow this &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide&#34;&gt;step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; by Microsoft to get started. Then, install Hyper for Windows from &lt;a href=&#34;https://releases.hyper.is/download/win&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you didn’t already, you will also need node.js for the package management for plugins of Hyper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#opening-the-config-file&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-the-config-file&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Opening the config file&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Hyper window, press &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + ,&lt;/code&gt;. It should open the config file “.hyper.js” with your default text editor. In case it throws an error, it is probably because Windows is trying to execute the js file instead of opening it for editing. You have 2 ways to work around this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Not recommended)&lt;/strong&gt; If you have an editor that can be opened through Powershell, then you can go ahead and do &lt;code&gt;atom .hyper.js&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever text editor yours is).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Recommended)&lt;/strong&gt; Navigate to the user folder with your File Explorer (“C:\Users%YourUserName%\”). Right click “.hyper.js”, select “Properties”, change the “Opens with: ” to a text editor like ‘Notepad’ etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, you should be able to pull up the config file easily with either pressing &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + ,&lt;/code&gt; or through the Hamburger Menu into ‘Edit’ → ‘Preferences’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#pointing-hyper-to-the-linux-shell&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;pointing-hyper-to-the-linux-shell&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Pointing Hyper to the Linux Shell&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the config file, look for the &lt;code&gt;shell: &#39;&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, option as seen from the screenshot above, change it to &lt;code&gt;shell: &#39;C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe\&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, as suggested by the comment. In my personal experience so far, neither keeping nor removing ‘shellArgs’ make any changes to the bash shell. While you are at it, feel free to add any kind of plugins you want to it. Personally, I added &lt;code&gt;&#39;hyperterm-cobalt2-theme&#39;&lt;/code&gt; because I like the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now be able to use Hyper just like a normal Linux Shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#general-development-environment-and-tools&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;general-development-environment-and-tools&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;General development environment and tools&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you will most likely be using this for development, you should definitely run the following commands to set yourself up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get update
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get upgrade
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install build-essential
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install python-pip
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;pip install --upgrade pip
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all of the above, installation of python-pip is crucial to the next step in installing Powerline for Hyper (or more like bash).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#installing-powerline&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-powerline&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Installing Powerline&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#this-section-is-referenced-from&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;this-section-is-referenced-from&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section is referenced from &lt;a href=&#34;http://iamnotmyself.com/2017/04/15/setting-up-powerline-shell-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux/&#34;&gt;SETTING UP POWERLINE SHELL ON WINDOWS SUBSYSTEM FOR LINUX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following to install Powerline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/banga/powerline-shell.git
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; powerline-shell
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;cat config.py.dist &amp;gt; config.py
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;./install.py
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING: you should not at anytime remove &lt;code&gt;powerline-shell&lt;/code&gt; folder (or attempt to) without reverting the following changes that you will make to the &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;nano .bashrc
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use any other command line editor if you prefer (I use vim personally). Add the following lines to the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$TERM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; !&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;linux&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;PROMPT_COMMAND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;_update_ps1; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$PROMPT_COMMAND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Note: If you happen use nano (like the given example), do note that &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+X&lt;/code&gt; will not exit the program. You can do &lt;code&gt;F2&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save and restart Hyper (or refresh) and it should look something like this. Realize the missing characters which are supposed to be the arrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/img/utImage2.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/2017-08-15-use-terminal-in-windows-with-style//blog/img/utImage2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#fonts-for-powerline&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&#34;fonts-for-powerline&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Fonts for Powerline&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the character to show, you will need Powerline fonts installed and set it in your config file &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + ,&lt;/code&gt; for Hyper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/powerline/fonts&#34;&gt;https://github.com/powerline/fonts&lt;/a&gt;, pick a font you like (I use monofur) or clone the repo and install all the fonts. Remember to install it as Windows, meaning you will be running the ps1 file (PowerShell) instead of the sh file. If it throws an error saying something along the lines of “running scripts is disabled”, follow the instructions &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.faqforge.com/windows/windows-powershell-running-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to enable it and run it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are done with the installation, remember to change the font through the config file, then reload Hyper. At this point, it should look something like the following screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://binhong.me/blog/img/utImage3.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;

        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#this-section-is-referenced-from-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&#34;this-section-is-referenced-from-1&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This section is referenced from &lt;a href=&#34;https://randika.com/installing-nvm-nodejs-and-npm-on-ubuntu-f6deef0cd22a&#34;&gt;Installing nvm, nodejs and npm on Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@randika&#34;&gt;Randika Rathugamage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious way to do this is by installing it through the default package manager. However, the npm installed through apt-get is 3.5.2 version without node. I personally prefer installing it with nvm starting by cloning the nvm repository and adding it to &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;source ~/nvm/nvm.sh&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; .bashrc
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here, you can either reset Hyper or do a &lt;code&gt;source .bashrc&lt;/code&gt; to get nvm working for you. After that, you can do &lt;code&gt;nvm ls-remote&lt;/code&gt; to look at all the versions available before deciding which to install or you can just do &lt;code&gt;nvm install node&lt;/code&gt; and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#optional-configuring-aliases&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;optional-configuring-aliases&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;(Optional) Configuring aliases&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the Linux file system is separated from the Windows file system (located in C:/User/your-name/AppData/Local/lxss). Windows went as far as to not show the folder in File Explorer even if you select to show hidden files just so you don’t mess with it. In one scenario where I made a change to one of the files in there from File Explorer through my text editor in Windows, the WSL no longer recognizes the existence of such file in the directory immediately.* This is why you should keep all your files in your Windows side of file system and access them through something like cd /mnt/e/git/. Retyping the file path over and over again can be annoying so instead, you can set an alias by adding the command below but changing the location to the directory where you store your development files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Workaround: I ended up creating a new file with vim in bash and copy pasting the entire existing file from Windows. I also renamed the files beforehand to prevent file conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;alias gitfiles=&amp;#34;cd /mnt/e/git/&amp;#34;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here on out, you can just do &lt;code&gt;gitfiles&lt;/code&gt; in Hyper (or bash) and you will go directly to your development folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#reset&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&#34;reset&#34;&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Reset&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at any point, you seems to have screwed up your Linux subsystem, you can always reset it by going to your command prompt &lt;code&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/code&gt; with admin privilege (Run as administrator) and input the following commands to reset the Linux subsystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I did this with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH&#34;&gt;zsh&lt;/a&gt; (since I personally uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k&#34;&gt;Powerlevel9k&lt;/a&gt; on my Mac and I love it) but zsh doesn’t seems to play well with Hyper (specifically with the plugins) causing a lot of weird configuration behaviors. Even without Hyper, the alignments for Powerlevel9k specifically goes way off causing the input line to be on the next line instead. I speculate this is due to zsh not being built with Windows in mind and does not have such compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
