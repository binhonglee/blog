Historically, my personal blog has been mostly about "how to do x", "guide on making y" but never about ideology or engineering practices. This new series intends to change that where I'll explore the more opinionated side of myself especially around engineering practices instead of just the _pure_ technical stuff.

## Topics

I have not fully planned out the entire series but here are a few topics I have in mind (or have released) so far...

1. [Push Fearlessly with Automated Testing](/blog/2025-05-04-push-fearlessly-with-automated-testing/)
2. Culture
    1. [The Art of Posting](/blog/2025-05-15-art-of-posting/)
    2. [Code Review Culture](/blog/2025-05-23-code-review-culture/)
3. Incident Management
    1. [No Blame SEV (Incident) Culture](/blog/2025-05-30-no-blame-sev-culture/)
    2. Major Incident Runbook
    3. Firefighting Heroes
4. Product Growth
    1. A/B Testing
    2. Product Growth Opportunities
    3. Growth Engineer
    4. Experiment Review Process
5. Internal Tools
    1. Internal Tooling Ideas
    2. Understanding the Value of Dev Tools

## Where is this coming from?

Back when I was working at Meta, I would generally build an idea proposal (on how / what to fix) around an opinionated piece like this. It largely serves like a RFC where I can gather other (both supporting or opposing) opinions and concerns before proceeding to make sure that I've considered everyone's perspective. The difference in this series however, I would focus more on exploring my personal opinions and why I feel strongly about them. It's up to you to decide whether it fits the bill for you.

## What should I do with this information?

These are not meant to be blind prescription (especially since your situation could very well be different from what I am / was going through) but rather as an extra perspective for consideration when deciding on relevant matters. As the title states, these are opinions with which you're open to have opposing views.
