I started taking some job interviews recently and realized that I'm not exactly the most proficient at the _project presentation_ stage. This series is my attempt at sharing these past project stories as a way to help me organize among them for different purposes. Basically by fleshing them all out, I can better visualize which project best demonstrate which skill of mine. These projects won't be released in the right chronological order. The idea is that each of them should be understood as a standalone piece as it would be presented to an interviewer. Consider this kinda like a mock interview for myself.

## Full Series

Here are some of the pieces that's been released (or planned) thus far:

- [Shipping a project with -2M MAP](/blog/2025-10-17-shipping-negative-2m-map/)
- Leaked `FakeIncorrectPassword`
- One liner increasing over 3M MAP
- Logged Out Internal Settings
- Threads Launch
- Password Encryption Gap
- Everyone, everything, logged out all at once
- 0-click account takeover

## Short Series

There are some fun shorter stories that won't be long enough to warrant an entire piece on it (and I'd probably never share them as part of my _project presentation_ interview). But they are still interesting enough that I'd share a few of them together in one piece every once in a while.
